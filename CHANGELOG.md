## [7.28.0] — 2026-06-23

Minor release — **v8.0 E3:** a one-shot setup doctor so a cold user reaches a useful answer fast.

### Added
- **`sigmap doctor` (#381):** a one-shot diagnostic that runs seven resilient checks — git repository, config & source roots, generated context file, signature index, index freshness, coverage, and MCP wiring — and prints an **actionable fix** for anything wrong (e.g. "run: npx sigmap", "run: sigmap --setup", "increase maxTokens or expand srcDirs"). `sigmap doctor --json` emits `{ checks, ok, errors, warnings }`; the command exits **1** on a hard failure (no context file / invalid config) and **0** otherwise, so it is usable in CI. Composed from `loadConfig`, `coverageScore`, `buildSigIndex`, and the known adapter-output / MCP-config paths — zero new runtime dependencies, no system-shell spawns.

### Changed
- **Release CI self-heals `develop` (#380):** the develop→main release PR's head branch is `develop`, which the repo's delete-branch-on-merge setting removes on every release; the "Sync develop with main" workflow now fetches `main` and recreates `develop` from it when the ref is missing (else merges `main` in), so `develop` no longer needs manual restoration after a release.

## [7.27.0] — 2026-06-22

Minor release — **v8.0 D3:** two new MCP tools, taking the server from 15 to 17 tools. Both are composed from data SigMap already computes — zero new runtime dependencies, no system-shell spawns.

### Added
- **`get_diff_context` MCP tool (#376):** for every changed file (working tree, staged via `staged`, or vs a base ref via `base`) returns its current **signatures** + **blast radius** (direct importers, transitive count, affected tests/routes) + a risk label — one call gives an agent everything a review or a safe edit needs. Lists changed files **shell-free** through `src/util/git.js` (no `/bin/sh`). Optional `depth` controls the blast-radius BFS.
- **`get_architecture_overview` MCP tool (#376):** a one-call codebase map — module breakdown (files/tokens), the most depended-on **hub files**, the dependency-**cycle** count, and route totals. Extends `get_map` for orienting in an unfamiliar repo. Composed from `buildSigIndex`, `buildFromCwd`, and `detectCycles`.

### Changed
- MCP surface count is now **17 tools** across `--help`, README, `docs-vp/guide/mcp.md`, `version.json` (`mcp_tools`), and the generated `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt`.

## [7.26.0] — 2026-06-22

Minor release — **v8.0 "The Evidence Pack & the Pivot" (E1):** the keystone artifact that makes SigMap consumable by machines instead of copy-paste.

### Added
- **Evidence Pack JSON v1 (#372):** new `sigmap evidence "<query>"` command emits a deterministic, machine-consumable signature-and-evidence map — a byte-stable JSON artifact (plus a `--markdown`/`--md` handoff rendering) that an agent or CI can ingest directly, every entry anchored to a real file, symbol, and line range. Schema v1: `{ schemaVersion, query, intent, files:[{ path, symbols, reason, confidence, sourceLines, relatedTests, riskLabel }], tokenBudget, droppedFiles, grounding:{ symbolCount, anchoredSymbols, anchorCoverage, contextHash, deterministic } }`. Composed entirely from shipped zero-dep modules (ranker, line-anchor parsing, security scanner, sha256 grounding hash). The pack carries **no wall-clock timestamp** — an unchanged repo yields byte-identical output and a stable `grounding.contextHash`, so the artifact is auditable. CLI flags: `--top`, `--budget`, `--out`; always writes `.context/evidence-pack.json`. `riskLabel` ∈ {generated, test, config, security, source} and `relatedTests` are best-effort v1 (measured test-discovery and richer labels land in v8.5).

## [7.25.2] — 2026-06-22

Patch release — **Trust Hygiene (H2):** reproducible bundle build. Completes the v7.25.x "Trust Hygiene" milestone (H1+H2+H3+H4 all shipped).

### Added
- **Reproducible bundle build (#369):** `scripts/build-bundle.mjs` (`npm run build:bundle`) deterministically regenerates the embedded `__factories` of `gen-context.js` from `src/` + `packages/adapters/` — sorted and de-duplicated — between two markers, leaving the preamble and the hand-written CLI core byte-identical. `build:bundle --check` asserts the committed bundle equals a fresh build and is wired into `prepublishOnly` and CI (next to the existing standalone `bundle-smoke` test on Node 18/20/22). A new `bundle-repro` test pins byte-for-byte reproducibility.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate / missing bundled modules (#369):** the bundle carried a duplicate `./src/eval/llm-ablation` factory (124 blocks for 115 `src/` modules) because `check-bundle --fix` prepended on each run; it now regenerates the whole section via `build-bundle`, so duplicates can't recur. The `willow` adapter — silently never embedded (the integrity check only verified `src/`) — is now bundled. The canonical bundle is **125 modules, one factory each**.

---

## [7.25.1] — 2026-06-21

Patch release — **Trust Hygiene (H4):** document the real CLI / MCP / adapter surface. Completes the v7.25.x milestone's documentation goals (only H2, the reproducible bundle build, remains).

### Added
- **Document the shipped surface (#366):** `sigmap --help` now lists the five wired-but-undocumented commands — `conventions`, `scaffold`, `verify-plan`, `review-pr`, and `create` (the grounded-creation pipeline). The README gains a "Grounded creation & guardrails" section, lists all 15 MCP tools, and adds the `willow` adapter to the integrations table. A new `surface-docs` test pins the documented surface to source (`--help` must list the commands, README's MCP count must equal `TOOLS.length`, every `listAdapters()` entry must appear in the README table), so the docs can never silently undersell the product again.

### Fixed
- **MCP tool undercount (#366):** the README advertised "10 on-demand tools" while the server ships **15** — corrected and now gated by the `surface-docs` test.

---

## [7.25.0] — 2026-06-21

Minor release — **Trust Hygiene (H1 + H3):** one generated source of benchmark truth, gated in CI. First installment of the v7.25.x milestone.

### Added
- **Single source of benchmark truth (#363):** `benchmarks/latest.json` is now generated from the benchmark reports (`scripts/gen-benchmark-latest.mjs`), and `version.json` metrics, `README.md` (via `<!--SM:KEY-->` markers), and `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` all read from it (`scripts/sync-metrics.mjs`). Every hand-typed metric is removed — published numbers can no longer silently drift from the measured reports. New `npm run metrics:sync` regenerates the whole chain; `npm run check:metrics` gates it in `prepublishOnly` **and** CI.
- **Truthful `version.json` (#363):** `languages`, `extractors`, `mcp_tools`, and `tests` are auto-derived from source via a shared `scripts/lib/source-meta.mjs` (the same derivation the llms generator uses, so the language count can never diverge). Added the `extractors` field.

### Changed
- **Every published number traces to one fresh, gated benchmark run (#363):** the long-standing drift (committed reports vs hand-typed README/`version.json`/`llms.txt`) is eliminated — all surfaces now derive from `benchmarks/latest.json`. This release regenerates that file from a **live** benchmark run (2026-06-21, `sigmap-v7.25-main`, 21 repos): hit@5 **75.6%** (13.6% baseline, 5.6× lift), token reduction **97%**, task success **52.2%**, prompts/task **1.72 → 2.84**, prompt reduction **39.4%**. `languages` corrected `31 → 33`; `extractors` (42) now reported.

---

## [7.24.2] — 2026-06-19

Patch release — surface the StarMapper stargazer map in the docs.

### Added
- **StarMapper stargazer-map badge + link (#360):** the README badge row gains a StarMapper badge and the Support section a "stargazers around the world" link; the docs site adds a community link — all pointing to the [StarMapper map](https://starmapper.bruniaux.com/manojmallick/sigmap) (517 stars across 37 countries). StarMapper is a client-rendered SPA with no verifiable badge endpoint, so a reliable shields.io static badge links to the map rather than embedding an unverifiable image. A README-structure test pins the StarMapper URL.

---

## [7.24.1] — 2026-06-19

Patch release — publish the first measured §9 grounding result.

### Added
- **§9 grounding result published (`version.json` `ablation`):** the first averaged §9 LLM A/B ablation on the fact-question corpus (v7.24.0) — 5 runs × 100 repo-fact tasks, Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash`. With SigMap's exact-signature grounding, flagged codebase-fact errors fell from **99.8 [99–100]** to **0.2 [0–1]** per 100 outputs (mean delta **99.6**). The ungrounded model, with no repo knowledge, fabricates a plausible-but-wrong file path on essentially every task (`src/sigmap/utils.py`, `src/sigmap/extract.py`, …); the grounded model — given exact signatures grouped by file — states the correct path. This measures **factual-recall grounding** (faithful use of provided context), not generative code correctness. Recorded under a new `ablation` block in `version.json`, separate from the retrieval/token/task metrics.

---

## [7.24.0] — 2026-06-19

Minor release — redesign the §9 ablation corpus so it measures grounding, not guard precision.

### Changed
- **§9 ablation corpus → checkable repo-fact questions (#356):** the previous "write a minimal example that requires X" tasks inherently elicited placeholder scaffolding (`src/main.js`, `minimal.js`, real modules referenced by basename), which a string-based guard cannot distinguish from claimed repo files — so the metric measured guard precision, not grounding. A 100-task run confirmed grounding drives *genuine* invented-file hallucinations to ~0 while with-arm scaffolding noise masked it (9 → 7). `scripts/gen-ablation-corpus.mjs` now generates fact questions — *"which file defines `<name>`, and what are its parameters?"* — where a wrong file path is an unambiguous, checkable hallucination and the prompt forbids example code. The grounded arm (given exact signatures grouped by file) answers correctly; the ungrounded arm must guess. Task ids `call-` → `fact-`; 100 real-symbol tasks; a regression test pins the methodology. Run: `npm run benchmark:llm-ablation -- --runs 5 --save`.

---

## [7.23.0] — 2026-06-19

Minor release — make the §9 LLM ablation produce a statistically stable number.

### Added
- **§9 ablation: `--runs N` averaging + 100-task corpus (#353):** the cleaned-guard §9 result is directionally clear (grounding cuts flagged codebase-fact errors ~13 → 3 per 100) but at N=40 with single-digit raw counts a single pass is noisy. `scripts/run-llm-ablation.mjs` gains `--runs N` (default 1) that runs the full task set N times with **fresh model calls per pass** and prints a mean ± [min–max] summary; `src/eval/llm-ablation.js` adds a pure, unit-tested `aggregateRuns(aggregates[])` (mean/min/max of without/with per-100 and delta). The committed corpus (`benchmarks/llm-ablation-tasks.json`) expands from 40 to **100** real-symbol tasks (`gen-ablation-corpus.mjs` default 40 → 100) for a tighter single-run estimate. The network touch stays confined to `scripts/`; the offline harness is unchanged. Run the robust headline with `npm run benchmark:llm-ablation -- --runs 5 --save`.

---

## [7.22.2] — 2026-06-19

Patch release — clears the two remaining `verify-ai-output` false-positive classes surfaced by the §9 ablation.

### Fixed
- **`verify-ai-output` no longer flags camelCase placeholders or documentation-placeholder imports (#350):** continuing from #347, the Hallucination Guard now also skips camelCase/Pascal placeholder filenames (`myExample.js`, `exampleConfig.ts`) via a case-boundary rule that still flags ordinary words (`resample.js`), and the `fake-import` detector skips obvious documentation placeholders (`@scope/utils`, `some-module`, `./local-file`, `./path/to/…`) while still flagging genuine missing packages and unresolved relative imports. In the §9 re-run after #347, grounding genuinely fixed 6 mis-path flags but the guard re-flagged 4 illustrative tokens (net +2); suppressing those exposes the true grounding signal (on those outputs, with-grounding flags drop 10 → 6, delta +2 → +9). The bundled `src/verify/parsers` and `src/verify/hallucination-guard` factories were regenerated for standalone-binary parity.

---

## [7.22.1] — 2026-06-18

Patch release — hardens the `verify-ai-output` file-path extractor against the dominant false-positive class.

### Fixed
- **`verify-ai-output` no longer flags runtime/library names or placeholder filenames (#347):** `extractFilePaths` now skips well-known `X.js` product names (`node.js`, `next.js`, `vue.js`, `express.js`, `three.js`, `d3.js`, …) and illustrative placeholder basenames (`example`/`sample`/`demo`/`placeholder`, including `minimal-example.js`). Genuine repo-shaped paths (`src/foo/bar.js`, `main.js`, `index.ts`) are still extracted, so real hallucinations are unaffected. This removes the dominant Hallucination Guard false-positive class — in the §9 ablation, 22 of ~34 flags were literally "Node.js" — turning the directional grounding delta into a clean signal. The bundled `src/verify/parsers` factory was regenerated for standalone-binary parity.

---

## [7.22.0] — 2026-06-18

Minor release — realistic §9 ablation (real-symbol corpus, exact-signature grounding, --verbose) + Gemini model fix.

### Added
- **Realistic §9 ablation — real-symbol corpus, exact-signature grounding, `--verbose` (#344):** the LLM A/B ablation now measures something meaningful. `buildGrounding` emits **exact signatures grouped by file** (what `get_callee_signatures` returns, bounded by `maxSignatures`) instead of a flat symbol-name dump — the real product behavior. New `scripts/gen-ablation-corpus.mjs` generates ~40 tasks from the repo's actual exported symbols/files (`benchmarks/llm-ablation-tasks.json`). `src/eval/llm-ablation.js` adds `scoreAnswerDetail` (count + issues) and `runAblation`'s `collectIssues`; the runner's `--verbose` prints every flagged item per arm. A 40-task Gemini run showed grounding reduced flagged errors 62.5 → 22.5 per 100 (directionally positive vs the earlier 4-task noise) — and `--verbose` revealed most flags are `verify-ai-output` file-path false-positives (e.g. "Node.js"), the next thing to harden before publishing a number.

### Fixed
- **Gemini default model (#343):** the ablation runner's default `gemini-2.0-flash` was retired by AI Studio (404 NOT_FOUND); the default is now the live `gemini-2.5-flash`. The `--model` flag selects any model.

---

## [7.21.0] — 2026-06-18

Minor release — LLM ablation runner gains a Gemini (AI Studio) provider.

### Added
- **Gemini provider for the §9 LLM A/B ablation runner (#340):** `scripts/run-llm-ablation.mjs` now supports Google Gemini via the AI Studio / Generative Language API (`generateContent`) alongside Anthropic. The provider is auto-detected from whichever key is present (`GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` → gemini; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → anthropic); `--provider` and `--model` override, with a sensible default model per provider (`gemini-2.0-flash` / `claude-sonnet-4-6`). The no-key path lists both providers and exits 0. Run with `GEMINI_API_KEY=… npm run benchmark:llm-ablation`. The network fetch stays confined to `scripts/` — never the published library surface; the offline harness (`src/eval/llm-ablation.js`) is unchanged.

---

## [7.20.0] — 2026-06-18

Minor release — `init` writes a Creation workflow block into CLAUDE.md (grounded codegen, Gap 2 §6.2 — completes the plan).

### Added
- **`sigmap --init` documents the grounded-creation workflow in CLAUDE.md (#337):** the final IMPL item. `--init` now injects a marker-delimited "Creation workflow" block describing the four-stage pipeline (`scaffold` → `verify-plan` → `verify-ai-output` → `review-pr`, orchestrated by `sigmap create`) so an agent reading CLAUDE.md knows the guard-rail workflow exists. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/init/creation-workflow.js` (`renderCreationWorkflowBlock`, `injectCreationWorkflow`); idempotent and marker-scoped (`<!-- sigmap-creation-workflow:start -->` … `:end -->`), it creates CLAUDE.md if absent, preserves human content, and coexists with the conventions + auto-generated-signatures blocks. **With this, every item in the grounded-codegen implementation plan is shipped** (the §9 LLM A/B ablation is built and offline-tested; a live run needs only an API key).

---

## [7.19.0] — 2026-06-18

Minor release — scaffold persistence (grounded codegen, Gap 2 §6.2).

### Added
- **Scaffold persistence — `.context/scaffold/latest.md` (#334):** `sigmap scaffold` now writes an accepted proposal to `.context/scaffold/latest.md` so the `create` pipeline and agents can read back the convention-matched proposal instead of re-deriving it. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/scaffold/persist.js` (`renderScaffoldMarkdown`, `scaffoldPath`); the record captures the filename + naming style, export style, test file + framework, and any force-warning. Persisted in both human and `--json` modes (the JSON output gains a `persistedTo` field); a refused scaffold writes nothing.

---

## [7.18.0] — 2026-06-18

Minor release — `sigmap conventions --update` (grounded codegen, Layer 3 — completes the §4 flag set).

### Added
- **`sigmap conventions --update` — incremental rescan (#331):** refreshes `.context/conventions.json` only when source files have changed since the last scan; otherwise reports "up to date" and exits without recomputing. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/conventions/update.js` (`changedSince`, `planUpdate`) compares source-file mtimes to the stored snapshot — `stale` when the snapshot is missing or any file is newer. The command re-extracts + rewrites when stale (reporting the changed count / "initial scan"), else skips the work. `--json` for machine output. This completes the IMPL §4 `conventions` flag set: `--conflicts`, `--inject`, `--report`, `--ci`, `--fix`, `--update`.

---

## [7.17.0] — 2026-06-18

Minor release — `sigmap conventions --fix` (grounded codegen, Layer 3 — completes the conventions flags).

### Added
- **`sigmap conventions --fix` — exhaustive rename/move checklist (#328):** the complete, actionable list of every source file whose name doesn't match the dominant convention, with full from→to paths, ready to paste into a task or PR. Distinct from `--conflicts` (a diagnostic summary with up to 3 example basenames) — `--fix` lists *every* offending file with its real path. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/conventions/fix.js` (`buildFixList`) reuses `classifyNaming` + `toNamingStyle`; the command prints a checkbox checklist + count (or "no fixes needed") and is read-only (it never performs renames). `--json` for machine output. This completes the `conventions` flag set (`--conflicts`, `--inject`, `--report`, `--ci`, `--fix`).

---

## [7.16.0] — 2026-06-18

Minor release — LLM A/B hallucination ablation harness (grounded codegen, IMPL §9).

### Added
- **LLM A/B hallucination ablation harness (#325):** the honest measurement behind the grounded-codegen plan (IMPL §9). Runs a model twice per task — (A) no SigMap context, (B) with SigMap grounding — pipes both outputs through the hallucination guard, and reports the measured delta in flagged codebase-fact errors. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/eval/llm-ablation.js` (`buildGrounding`, `scoreAnswer`, `runAblation`) keeps the model call **injected**, so the harness is fully offline-testable; the live runner `scripts/run-llm-ablation.mjs` wires Anthropic via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and prints the A/B table + delta (`npm run benchmark:llm-ablation`), degrading to a graceful skip (exit 0) when no key is set. The network fetch is confined to `scripts/`, never the published library surface. Starter corpus in `benchmarks/llm-ablation-tasks.json`. This turns §9 from an offline coverage proxy into a ready-to-run real A/B — the moment a key is present, it produces the measured hallucination delta.

---

## [7.15.0] — 2026-06-18

Minor release — `sigmap conventions --ci` (grounded codegen, Layer 3 polish).

### Added
- **`sigmap conventions --ci` — gate CI on convention consistency (#322):** completes the consistency-tracking story started by `--report` (v7.14.0). A CI gate that fails when a repo's overall convention consistency falls below a threshold (`--min`, default 0.70), and — with `--no-regress` — also fails when the score dropped vs the last recorded snapshot (best-effort). New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/conventions/ci.js` (`ciGate`) reuses `overallScore`; the command is read-only (reads the last `.context/conventions-history.ndjson` snapshot for `--no-regress`, never appends) and exits non-zero on failure, so it drops straight into CI. `--json` for machine output. The remaining `conventions` flags (`--fix`, `--update`) and the §9 LLM A/B benchmark are follow-ups.

---

## [7.14.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — `sigmap conventions --report` (grounded codegen, Layer 3 polish).

### Added
- **`sigmap conventions --report` — consistency audit + trend vs last run (#319):** the next `conventions` flag (IMPL.md §4). Reports a per-convention consistency score (file naming, export style) and a single file-count-weighted **overall consistency score**, each with a delta vs the previous run — a trackable "how consistent is our style, and is it improving?" number. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/conventions/report.js` (`scoreReport`, `snapshot`, `overallScore`); the command compares against the last snapshot in `.context/conventions-history.ndjson`, prints the audit with ▲/▼ trend arrows, and appends a fresh snapshot. `--json` for machine output. The remaining `conventions` flags (`--fix`, `--update`, `--ci`) and the §9 LLM A/B benchmark are follow-ups.

---

## [7.13.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — `sigmap create` (grounded codegen, Gap 2 — the pipeline capstone).

### Added
- **`sigmap create "<task>"` — orchestrate the 4-stage grounded-creation pipeline (#316):** the capstone of the grounded-codegen work. One command sequences the four guard stages — `scaffold` → `verify-plan` → `verify-ai-output` → `review-pr` — with `1/4`…`4/4` numbering and a single pass/fail summary. Each stage runs only when its input is present (`--name` → scaffold, `--plan` → verify-plan, `--answer` → verify-ai-output, the git diff → review-pr); a stage with no input is skipped and does not fail the run. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/create/orchestrate.js` (`orchestrate`) delegates to the real stage modules — no logic duplication. CLI supports `--name`, `--plan`, `--answer`, `--staged`/`--base`, and `--json`, and exits non-zero when a ran stage fails. This completes the grounded-creation loop: every root cause (1–4) is closed and all four guard stages are now sequenced by one command.

---

## [7.12.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — `sigmap review-pr` (grounded codegen, Gap 2 — last guard stage).

### Added
- **`sigmap review-pr` — diff audit for drift + side effects (#313):** the last guard stage of the `sigmap create` pipeline (IMPL.md §6 step 4). After a PR is opened, it audits the diff for **scope drift** (too many distinct top-level dirs), **god-node edits** (changed files with transitive dependents above a threshold, via the impact graph), **missing tests** (a changed source file with no matching changed test), and **security-sensitive files** (`.env*`, auth, secrets, `package.json`/lockfiles, `.github/workflows/**`, Dockerfiles, keys). New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/review/review-pr.js` (`reviewPr`); deletions are excluded from the source/security checks. CLI `review-pr [--base <ref>] [--staged] [--json]` collects the diff via shell-free git and exits non-zero when any finding is present (CI-gate). With this, all four create-pipeline guard stages exist (`scaffold` → `verify-plan` → `verify-ai-output` → `review-pr`); the `sigmap create` orchestrator remains the final follow-up.

---

## [7.11.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — `sigmap verify-plan` (grounded codegen, Gap 2).

### Added
- **`sigmap verify-plan <plan.md>` — check a plan against the live index (#310):** the first piece of the `sigmap create` pipeline (Gap 2, step 2). Before an agent executes a plan, `verify-plan` validates it against the live index — referenced files and symbols exist, blast radius is acceptable, scope is in bounds — catching Cause 1+2 at plan time (cheaper than after the code is written). New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/plan/verify-plan.js` (`verifyPlan`): flags missing files and unknown symbols (with closest-match suggestions), computes per-file blast radius via the impact graph (flags high-blast-radius files), and flags broad scope. Plan input schema is **markdown** (consistent with `verify-ai-output`). CLI reads a file or stdin (`-`), supports `--json`, and exits 1 on blocking errors. The `sigmap create` orchestration and `review-pr` remain follow-ups.

---

## [7.10.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — `sigmap scaffold` with a confidence floor (grounded codegen, Layer 4).

### Added
- **`sigmap scaffold <name>` — convention-matched proposal with a confidence floor (#307):** the first slice of Layer 4 (Cause 3 — guessing structure for new code). Proposes a convention-matched structure for a new module — filename in the repo's dominant naming style, the export style to use, and a matching test file — but **only when the conventions are consistent enough**. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/scaffold/propose.js` (`proposeScaffold`): the governing confidence is file-naming consistency, with a soft threshold (default 0.70, overridable via `--threshold`) and a **non-overridable hard floor of 0.50**. Below the threshold it refuses and surfaces the conflict (reusing `analyzeConflicts`); `--force` allows a proposal between the floor and the threshold (flagged with a warning), but never below the floor — a wrong proposal systematizes bad code. CLI supports `--ext`, `--threshold`, `--force`, and `--json` (refusal exits 1). Scaffold persistence (`.sigmap/scaffold/latest.md`), `--naming-pattern` override, and the `verify-plan` → `create` → `review-pr` pipeline remain follow-ups.

---

## [7.9.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — `sigmap conventions --inject` (grounded codegen, Layer 3).

### Added
- **`sigmap conventions --inject` — write the conventions block into CLAUDE.md (#304):** the next slice of Layer 3, completing the "agent sees the house style" link in the grounded-creation loop. Renders the detected conventions (file naming, export style, test framework — each with its dominant pattern and consistency tier) into a marker-delimited block and injects it into `CLAUDE.md`, creating the file if absent. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/conventions/inject.js` (`renderConventionsBlock`, `injectConventions`): the injection is idempotent and marker-scoped (`<!-- sigmap-conventions:start -->` … `:end -->`), preserving all human content and coexisting with the existing `## Auto-generated signatures` block. `--report`, `--fix`, `--update`, `--ci`, and Layer 4 scaffold remain follow-ups.

---

## [7.8.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — `sigmap conventions --conflicts` (grounded codegen, Layer 3).

### Added
- **`sigmap conventions --conflicts` — per-convention breakdown + rename suggestions (#301):** the next slice of Layer 3. Where `conventions` reports the dominant pattern and a consistency tier, `--conflicts` surfaces *why* a convention is mixed — every variant pattern with its file count, share, a visual bar, and example files, plus rename suggestions that move minority file-naming files toward the dominant style. New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/conventions/conflicts.js` (`analyzeConflicts`, `toNamingStyle`, `renameSuggestion`); export-style conflicts list variants but no renames (that's a code change, not a rename). `scoreConvention(labels, refs?)` now attaches up to 3 example files per variant (backward compatible). `--json` emits the structured conflict report; a consistent repo prints "no conflicts". `--report`, `--fix`, `--update`, `--ci`, and CLAUDE.md injection remain follow-ups.

---

## [7.7.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — `sigmap conventions` (grounded codegen, Layer 3).

### Added
- **`sigmap conventions` — extract & report a repo's coding conventions (#298):** the first slice of Layer 3 (grounded code generation). Detects the dominant **file naming** style, **export style**, and **test framework** for TS/JS/Python so generated code matches the house style instead of drifting (Cause 4: naming/convention drift). New zero-dependency, bundle-safe `src/conventions/extract.js` exposes `classifyNaming` (PascalCase / camelCase / kebab-case / snake_case), `scoreConvention` (a reusable consistency scorer returning `{ dominant, dominantPct, variants, tier }` with tiers at 90% / 70% — Gap 1's scaffold-confidence floor will reuse it), and `extractConventions`. The command writes `.context/conventions.json` and prints a readable report; `--json` emits machine output. `--conflicts`, `--fix`, `--ci`, and CLAUDE.md injection are deferred to follow-ups.

---

## [7.6.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — the grounding benchmark (the offline GATE for grounded codegen).

### Added
- **Grounding benchmark — `npm run benchmark:grounding` (#294):** a deterministic, offline callee-grounding ablation that measures how much ground truth SigMap actually gives an agent. For each corpus repo: `coverage = grounded / universe`, where universe is every symbol defined in the source and grounded is the subset SigMap surfaces in its index (resolvable by `get_callee_signatures`); baseline is 0 (no SigMap → guess every reference). `scripts/run-hallucination-benchmark.mjs` prints per-repo + aggregate coverage; `--save` writes `benchmarks/reports/hallucination.json`; `--gate <pct>` exits non-zero below a threshold. It's an honest *ground-truth-availability proxy*, not a measured LLM hallucination rate (the LLM A/B ablation is a documented follow-up needing an API key). No LLM, no network — runs in CI.

---

## [7.5.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — read-time self-heal completes Layer 1 freshness.

### Added
- **Read-time self-heal — live index without agent hooks (#290):** the v7.4.0 write hooks kept the index fresh only if the agent called them; now `search_signatures` / `get_callee_signatures` reconcile the index with the source tree *on read*, so on-disk edits show up even when no hook fired — closing that single point of failure. New `src/cache/freshen.js` re-extracts files modified since the last `generate` (bounded to actual session edits, not the whole tree), persists to the sig-cache (which `buildSigIndex` merges), and is throttled per repo. Deletions stay the job of `sigmap_notify_file_deleted` (a cache entry may be a notify overlay for a not-yet-on-disk file). Verified end-to-end in the standalone bundle.

---

## [7.4.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — live-index write hooks (grounded codegen, Layer 1).

### Added
- **MCP write hooks — live index for agent-created code (#286):** three new tools — `sigmap_notify_file_created`, `sigmap_notify_symbol_added`, `sigmap_notify_file_deleted` — keep the index fresh while an agent creates/modifies/deletes files mid-session, so newly-written symbols are immediately resolvable by `search_signatures` / `get_callee_signatures` instead of being re-hallucinated. They update the persisted sig-cache, which `buildSigIndex` already merges, so changes are live on the next read. New bundle-safe `src/extractors/dispatch.js` (static extractor dispatch for the standalone bundle). Brings the MCP server to **15 tools**.

### Fixed
- **Standalone-bundle cache merge (#286):** the bundled `ranker` factory carried a raw `require('../cache/sig-cache')` that was never rewritten to `__require`, so the cache merge — and `get_callee_signatures`' cache path — silently failed in the SEA binary. Regenerated the factory; the full create→resolve→delete cycle now works from the bundle with no `src/` present.

---

## [7.3.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — a 12th MCP tool that gives agents exact callee signatures before they write.

### Added
- **`get_callee_signatures` MCP tool (#282):** returns the exact current signature(s) of named symbols (functions, classes, methods) from the index, so an agent never guesses a callee's parameter types from training memory — the highest-ROI step toward grounded code generation. Input `{ symbols: string[] }`; unknown names get a closest-match suggestion (reuses `verify/closest-match`). Brings the MCP server to **12 tools**. Wired into the standalone bundle (regenerated `mcp/*` factories) and validated end-to-end via the bundle-driven MCP test.

---

## [7.2.1] — 2026-06-17

Patch release — realistic per-query savings.

### Fixed
- **`ask` / `gain` baseline reflects real usage (#278):** `sigmap ask` measured savings against the *whole repo* (every query assumed feeding the entire source tree), which inflated the `gain` dashboard (cumulative baselines in the millions) and showed ~99% per query. The baseline is now the full content of the files SigMap actually surfaced for the query (the ranked top-K) — the true counterfactual: without SigMap you'd read those files in full; SigMap gives you their signatures. Drives the `ask` cost line, `--json savingsPct`, and the `gain` record. `generate` keeps the whole-repo baseline (it genuinely indexes every file → signatures).

---

## [7.2.0] — 2026-06-17

Minor release — release-pipeline robustness. Hardens the bundle/release machinery that produced the v7.1.0 binary failure, with no user-facing CLI changes.

### Added
- **Bundle integrity check (#266):** `scripts/check-bundle.mjs` verifies every `src/` module is registered in `gen-context.js` `__factories` (the standalone/SEA-binary code path). Runs in CI on every PR (Node 18/20/22) and in `prepublishOnly`; `--fix` inserts missing factories from source. `build-binary.mjs` reuses the same check. Catches — before merge — the gap that broke the v7.1.0 binaries.
- **version.json metadata gate (#268):** `scripts/check-version-meta.mjs` derives `mcp_tools` (from `src/mcp/tools.js`) and `tests` (test-file count) and fails on drift; wired into `prepublishOnly`. `languages` stays editorial. Corrected stale `tests` count.
- **Standalone-bundle smoke test (#274):** runs `gen-context.js` from a temp dir with no `src/` present (the binary path) — `generate` + `--health` + `gain` — in the Node 18/20/22 matrix. Functional complement to the presence check.
- **`docs/RELEASING.md` (#274):** documents the release flow, branch model, tag triggers, and the prepublish/CI gates.

### Fixed
- **`--health` clarity (#270):** the per-repo "extractor coverage" line (languages present in this repo ÷ supported) read as contradictory beside a 100/100 score. Relabeled as informational ("repo languages … not scored") with a "score basis" line. The `--health --json` `extractorCoverage` field is unchanged.

### Changed
- **Repo declutter (#272):** removed the committed, unreferenced `TESTING_IMPORT_GRAPH.md` (gitignored); stale planning docs archived out of the repo. `PROJECT_MAP.md` kept (live generated artifact).

---

## [7.1.0] — 2026-06-16

Minor release — a token-savings dashboard in the terminal, plus domain and sponsorship docs.

### Added
- **Token-savings dashboard — `sigmap gain` (#260):** surfaces cumulative savings right in the terminal — total tokens saved, % efficiency, estimated $ saved, latency, and a by-operation breakdown, plus `gain --all` for daily / weekly / monthly trends. Savings are captured per operation (`ask`, `generate`) into a dedicated local log `.context/gain.ndjson` (counts only — no paths, source, or query text). Capture is **default-on** and privacy-safe; opt out via `--no-track`, `SIGMAP_NO_TRACK=1`, or `config.gainTracking:false`. The legacy `usage.ndjson` / `--track` health log is unchanged. New `src/tracking/{aggregate,pricing}.js` (zero-dep aggregation + model→$/Mtok pricing) and `src/format/gain-terminal.js` (ANSI renderer, `NO_COLOR`/non-TTY safe). Flags: `gain --all | --json | --since <7d|ISO> | --top <n> | --model <name> | --reset`. "Saved" is labeled everywhere as an estimate vs the whole-file baseline.

### Fixed
- **Docs served at the sigmap.io root (#258):** the docs site now builds with base `/` (dropped the `/sigmap/` path prefix) and the project domain points to sigmap.io.

### Changed
- **Sponsorship transparency (#257):** README gained a Sponsor section with a tier ladder and funding goal; detail moved into `SPONSOR.md`, with an "About the maintainer" note and a low-barrier welcome.

---

## [7.0.1] — 2026-06-14

Patch release — supply-chain hardening and package hygiene, plus a wider star nudge.

### Fixed
- **Eliminated system-shell access (#252):** every `child_process.execSync` call (which runs via `/bin/sh -c`) was converted to shell-free `execFileSync` with an arguments array. Several commands had previously interpolated values into the command string (`git diff ${range}`, `HEAD~${n}`, `printf '%s' … | ${clipCmd}`, `node -e "…http.get…"`) — a real shell-injection surface. New `src/util/git.js` (`git()`/`tryGit()`) centralizes shell-free git; the `extends` config fetch passes the URL as an argv to node; `compare` spawns node by argv; clipboard copy writes via stdin. Net: zero `execSync`/`exec`/`shell:true` in the published surface, which clears Socket's "Shell access" capability alert.

### Changed
- **Star nudge now counts plain `sigmap` runs (#251):** the one-time GitHub-star nudge previously only counted `ask`/`squeeze`. Users who only run `sigmap` to generate the context file now also reach the 10-run threshold. Counted once per process at the end of generation (monorepo-safe, tracked at the repo root); interactive-only — silent under `--json`/`--report`/`--quiet`/non-TTY.
- **`main` points at the importable core (#252):** `package.json` `main` changed from the CLI bundle (`gen-context.js`, which runs `main()` + exits on `require`) to `packages/core/index.js`, matching `exports["."]`. Bundlephobia and legacy resolvers now see the real zero-dep API.
- **Removed unused device fingerprint (#252):** the star nudge no longer records `machineId = sha256(os.hostname())` in `.context/usage.json` — it was never read or transmitted. Dropped the now-unused `os`/`crypto` requires.

---

## [7.0.0] — 2026-06-14

Major release — **Squeeze** makes `ask` minimize pasted input by default, a behavioral change to the core command.

### Added
- **Squeeze — input minimization (#238):** `sigmap ask` now classifies a pasted blob (stack trace / CI log / JSON) and minimizes it before ranking — deduping frames, stripping vendor noise, collapsing repeated array items — and **enriches the top stack frame** with its real signature from the symbol index. New `sigmap squeeze <file|->` command and `--squeeze` (auto-accept), `--no-squeeze`, `--squeeze-threshold N` flags. New `src/squeeze/{classify,cilog,stacktrace,jsonpayload,index}.js`; zero-dep, deterministic, offline.
- **Star Nudge (#238):** a one-time, race-safe GitHub-star prompt after ≥10 runs / ≥8 successes (`.context/usage.json`).
- **`llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt` generator (#243):** SigMap's own LLM reference is generated from source of truth (MCP tools, config keys, languages, `version.json` metrics, CLI help), validated in CI so it can never go stale, and published to the docs site + repo root. `npm run generate:llms` / `validate:llms`; `prepublishOnly` regenerates before publish.
- **npm discoverability + GitHub Sponsors (#241):** benefit-driven description, 20 keywords, `funding` field + `.github/FUNDING.yml`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: `sigmap ask` now classifies its input and may prompt** to minimize large pasted stack traces / logs / JSON before ranking. Interactive only — piped/CI usage is unaffected (no prompt), and `--no-squeeze` fully disables it.
- **Token budget keeps full signatures (#240):** when context exceeds `maxTokens`, low-priority files are dropped (and only marginal overflow collapses to anchors) — signatures keep their parameters/return types instead of being gutted to bare line anchors. The repo's own context config raises `maxTokens` (auto-scaling off) so it fits all files with full signatures.
- **One consistent usage block (#240):** every generated context file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / copilot-instructions.md / …) now carries a single canonical `## SigMap commands` block emitted from `formatOutput`; the redundant `## Tools` JSON in AGENTS.md was removed.
- **Benchmark repos pinned to fixed commits (#236):** retrieval/token benchmarks now clone pinned SHAs, so metrics move only when SigMap changes — not when upstream repos do.

### Fixed
- **Signatures no longer gutted under budget (#240):** the headline regression in the generated context files is resolved (see Changed).
- **prdiff symbol-name extraction (#247):** the changes block no longer emits phantom 2-char fragments (e.g. `+is`/`~is`); `extractName` now handles `export class`, `const x = () =>`, async/visibility modifiers, and returns nothing for re-export lines.

---

## [6.15.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **`verify-ai-output` — Hallucination Guard Reliable MVP (Phase 1, #232):**
  - Two new deterministic detectors — **`fake-test-file`** (a referenced `*.test`/`*.spec`/`__tests__`/`test_*.py` path absent on disk, reported separately from `fake-file`) and **`fake-npm-script`** (`npm run X` where `X` is not a `package.json` script).
  - **Closest-match suggestions** (`src/verify/closest-match.js`) — Levenshtein + file-proximity over the symbol index attaches a heuristic hint to flagged names ("Did you mean `loadConfig()` in `src/config/loader.js:42`?"). Labeled as heuristic, with its own confidence bucketing.
  - **Finalized JSON schema** — every issue now carries `{ type, value, line, location, message, confidence, suggestion }`; `summary` gains `withSuggestion`. Detection confidence is `high` for path/dep/script checks and `medium` for symbol checks.
  - **Parser hardening** — multi-line `import { … } from '…'` statements and TypeScript `import X = require('…')` are now detected; `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn run` script references are extracted.
  - **HTML report view** (`src/format/verify-report.js`) — `sigmap verify-ai-output <answer> --report [out.html]` writes a standalone, self-contained red/amber/green report (no external assets/scripts); a Markdown renderer shares the same structure for CI/PR comments.
  - **Proof harness** — `npm run benchmark:verify` scores each detector group against labeled cases and enforces precision targets (file ≥ 95%, import ≥ 85%, symbol ≥ 75%, script ≥ 95%), emitting a precision/recall CSV. Runs offline via a synthetic self-test; point it at real repos with `--manifest`.
  - New guide: `docs-vp/guide/verify-ai-output.md`.
- **Memory tools — `note`, `status`, and the `read_memory` MCP tool (Phase 1.5, #233):** closes the cold-start gap so an agent can recall *what we were doing and why* without re-scanning the repo.
  - **`sigmap note "<text>"`** — append to a cross-session decision log stored as append-only NDJSON at `.context/notes.ndjson` (each entry records text, ISO timestamp, and git branch). `sigmap note` with no text lists recent notes (`--list <N>`, `--json`). New module `src/session/notes.js`.
  - **`sigmap status`** — repo state at a glance: branch (with an unborn-branch fallback), dirty-file count, last index run (time, version, file count) with a **staleness** signal (tracked files modified since the last index), and notes summary. `--json` supported.
  - **`read_memory` MCP tool (11th tool)** — returns recent notes (most recent first) plus the last ranking-session focus from `ask`, formatted for agent consumption. Registered in `src/mcp/tools.js`, `handlers.js`, and `server.js`; bundled into the standalone binary.
  - New guide: `docs-vp/guide/memory.md`.
- The `verify-ai-output` (29 cases) and new `memory-tools` (13 cases) integration suites are now part of `npm run test:integration`.

### Changed
- MCP server now exposes **11 tools** (was 10) with the addition of `read_memory`; `version.json` `mcp_tools`, the `mcp.md` guide, and all tool-count test gates updated accordingly.

### Fixed
- `npm run test:integration` referenced a non-existent `test/integration/mcp-server.test.js`; corrected to `test/integration/mcp/server.test.js`.

---

## [6.14.0] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- **`verify-ai-output` — Hallucination Guard prototype (Phase 1 MVP, #227, PR #228):**
  - New command `sigmap verify-ai-output <answer.md> [--json]` flags fabricated claims in an AI answer against the real repository. Deterministic core — runs fully offline, no LLM.
  - Three detectors: **fake-file** (referenced path absent on disk), **fake-import** (relative import does not resolve; bare import absent from `package.json` deps, with Node/Python builtins allow-listed and scoped packages handled), and **fake-symbol** (called function/class absent from the SigMap symbol index via `buildSigIndex`).
  - Markdown report by default, `--json` for CI (`{ file, issues, summary }`). Exits `1` when any issue is found, `0` when clean.
  - New modules `src/verify/parsers.js` (file/import/symbol/code-block extraction) and `src/verify/hallucination-guard.js` (`verify(answerText, cwd, opts)`); all external lookups are injectable so the core is unit-testable.

### Fixed

- **Standalone binary build:** registered the new `src/verify/parsers` and `src/verify/hallucination-guard` modules in the `gen-context.js` `__factories` bundle. Without them the Release Binaries (Node SEA) build failed its pre-flight check (`missing from __factories`); `requireSourceOrBundled` falls back to `__require` in the single-file binary where `src/` is not present.

---

## [6.13.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Line anchors for JavaScript + member-level anchors (Surgical Context Phase 2.1, #223, PR #224):**
  - The **JavaScript extractor** now emits `:start-end` line anchors on top-level functions, classes, exported arrow functions, and `module.exports` — previously only TypeScript and Python carried anchors. JS block-comment stripping switched to the newline-preserving blank so anchor line numbers stay exact below a `/* … */`.
  - **Class methods and interface members** (TypeScript **and** JavaScript) now carry their **own** `:start-end` anchor spanning the member body, instead of inheriting nothing — unlocking method-level targeting with the `get_lines` MCP tool.
  - Measured effect: index-mode token reduction on real repos rises from ~4.6% to **32–42%** (axios 42.1%, fastify 41.1%, svelte 36.8%, vue-core 32.4%), now 100% anchored.

### Changed

- The bundled standalone `gen-context.js` extractor factories are re-synced with `src/` (the bundle had been stale since v6.11.0), so anchors work in the single-file distribution too.

### Fixed

- **Token budget could exceed `maxTokens` with many files.** The budget was signature-only and undercounted per-file section headers plus the fixed ~150-token preamble; with anchored (collapsible) signatures keeping more files alive, output could overflow. `applyTokenBudget` now budgets *rendered* cost (signatures + section overhead) against `maxTokens` minus a `max(200, 10%)` preamble reserve.

---

## [6.12.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Surgical Context Phase 2 — demand-driven retrieval (#219, PR #220):**
  - **`get_lines` MCP tool** (10th tool) — fetch an exact `{ file, start, end }` line range on demand. Lines are clamped to the file bounds, secret-scanned via the existing redactor, and sandboxed to the project root. This is the demand-driven workhorse: agents read the lines behind a `:start-end` anchor instead of re-opening whole files.
  - **`sigmap ask --mode index`** — two-tier output that emits only symbol-header pointers (`symbol  :start-end`), dropping parameter lists, return types, and bodies. Agents re-fetch bodies via `get_lines`.
  - **`sigmap ask --since <ref>`** — delta context that restricts ranked output to files changed since a git ref.
- **Token Reduction dashboard panel (Surface A)** — `sigmap --report` now renders a "Token Reduction" panel (whole-file baseline vs ranked signatures vs surgical, with per-repo rows), sourced from `benchmarks/reports/token-reduction.json` — numbers are never hand-typed.
- New **Surgical Context** guide (`docs-vp/guide/surgical-context.md`) covering line anchors, `--mode index`, `--since`, and the `get_lines` MCP tool.

### Changed

- **Budget-aware progressive disclosure** — when generated context exceeds `maxTokens`, the token budget now collapses signature bodies to their line anchors (keeping `symbol  :start-end`) *before* dropping whole files, degrading gracefully.
- **CI** — added `workflow_dispatch` to the develop→main sync workflow so it can be run on demand (PR #218).

---

## [6.11.1] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **MCP hot-cold cold signatures in bundled server** — the bundled MCP server now includes the hot-cold "cold" signatures, so context lookups return complete results under the hot-cold strategy (closes #201, PR #216). Thanks @rudi193-cmd.

---

## [6.11.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Line anchors on signatures (Surgical Context Phase 1)** — top-level TypeScript and Python signatures now carry a `:start-end` line anchor (e.g. `export class UserRepository  :18-36`), so agents can read the exact lines instead of re-opening whole files. Rendered automatically by `ask`, `CLAUDE.md`, and every adapter — no consumer changes (closes #212).
- New shared `src/extractors/line-anchor.js` helper (`lineAt`, `anchor`, `withAnchor`).

### Fixed

- **Block-comment / docstring line-shift bug** — comment stripping that blanked `/* */` and `"""…"""` to `''` destroyed newlines and corrupted line numbers. Replaced with a newline-preserving strip so char-offset → line-number stays exact. The Python AST and regex fallback paths now produce identical anchors.

---

## [6.10.12] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Portable `.mcp.json` support** — MCP server registration now detects and prioritizes `.mcp.json` at the project root, making MCP configuration portable across multiple agentic harnesses (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.). Falls back to `.claude/settings.json` if `.mcp.json` doesn't exist (closes #209).

---

## [6.10.11] — 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Test assertions** — Updated integration tests to verify correct benchmark date (2026-05-22) and language count (31 with R + GDScript support). Tests now validate version.json metrics consistency across all documentation files.

---

## [6.10.10] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **First-class R support** — R was already in the language detector and had an extractor, but several gaps stopped it from being usable end-to-end:
  - Registered `.r`/`.R` in `gen-context.js` `EXT_MAP` so the main pipeline actually invokes the R extractor (previously wired into the eval/analyzer path only).
  - Extended the dependency-graph builder (`src/graph/builder.js`) with an R branch: parses `source("path/file.R")` calls and, for R packages, resolves `localPkg::fn` references to the file that defines `fn` via a one-pass symbol scan over `R/`. `buildFromCwd` defaults now include `R/` and `inst/` dirs and Shiny entry files (`app.R`, `server.R`, `ui.R`, `global.R`).
  - Extended the R extractor (`src/extractors/r.js`) with R6 class detection (`Name <- R6Class("Name", public = list(...))`), S7 class detection (`Name <- new_class("Name", ...)` + `method(generic, Name) <- function(...)`), and roxygen2 docstring hints appended to function/class sigs (mirroring the Python extractor's docstring pattern).
  - New `src/discovery/r-manifest.js` module with zero-dep parsers for `DESCRIPTION` (Debian-control format, handles continuation lines and version constraints) and `NAMESPACE` (`export`, `exportPattern`, `exportMethods`, `S3method`, `importFrom`).
  - Added `extractRDeps` to `src/extractors/deps.js` for the dep-map section, recognising `library()`/`require()`/`requireNamespace("…")` and `pkg::fn`, skipping R base packages.
  - Extended the ranker's hub heuristic to recognise `R/utils.R`, `R/zzz.R`, `R/globals.R` and `*.r/*.R` files in the common hub-name set.
  - Test fixture `test/fixtures/r-package/` (DESCRIPTION + NAMESPACE + `R/`) and 8 new tests in `test/r-language.test.js` cover manifest parsing, `source()` edge emission, namespace-aware resolution, and hub detection. Existing `test/fixtures/r.r` extended with R6/S7/richer roxygen2 (closes #190).

### Fixed

- **MCP handler improvements** — Merged hot-cold cache and context-cold support into MCP index. MCP tools (`read_context`, `search_signatures`, `get_map`) now correctly serve signatures from multiple sources: primary context file (copilot-instructions.md), cold storage (context-cold.md), and sig-cache index. Fixes issue where MCP clients received partial results when using hot-cold or per-module output strategies.
- **Ranker hot-cold support** — Extended `buildSigIndex()` to merge signature indexes from multiple sources (primary file + context-cold.md + sig-cache). Added internal helper functions `_mergeSigIndex()`, `_buildSigIndexFromCache()`, and `_enrichSigIndexFromStrategy()` to support hot-cold and memory-efficient strategies without API breakage. Allows monorepo and per-module output strategies to serve complete signatures to rank and MCP handlers.
- **Windows path normalization in get_impact** — Implement case-insensitive path lookups in dependency graph for Windows compatibility. All paths in forward/reverse maps now normalized to lowercase, enabling `get_impact` to work correctly when file paths have different case (e.g., `src/Ledger/equity_ledger.py` vs `src/ledger/equity_ledger.py`). Applied normalization uniformly across JS, Python, Go, Rust, JVM, Ruby, and R import detection (closes #193).

---

## [6.10.9] — 2026-05-12

### Changed

- **Documentation updates** — Updated roadmap to reflect v6.10.8 completion with Python import detection in builder.js for get_impact MCP tool.

---

## [6.10.8] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **Python absolute imports in builder.js for get_impact** — Added Python absolute import detection to `src/graph/builder.js` used by the `get_impact` MCP tool. Previously only `import-graph.js` had this support, causing `get_impact` to return empty blast radius for Python monorepos. Now both tools correctly detect `from package.module import X` patterns (closes #187).

---

## [6.10.7] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **Python absolute imports in bundled gen-context.js** — Added Python absolute import detection (`from package.module import X`) to bundled extractImports function. The source code had this support but it was missing from the bundle, causing MCP tools to show empty import graphs for Python monorepos. Now matches source behavior correctly.

---

## [6.10.6] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Python absolute import detection** — Detects `from package.module import X` patterns in Python files, fixing empty import graphs for monorepos. Handles nested imports like `from services.auth.oauth import get_token` correctly (closes #181).
- **Comprehensive import graph diagnostics** — New `sigmap-diagnostics.js` tool and `src/analysis/diagnostics.js` module provide per-file metrics and budget decision explanations. Helps debug why files are included/excluded and why import graphs may be empty (closes #182).
- **Regression tests for MCP tools** — Added 8 comprehensive tests covering simple projects, monorepos, circular imports, and Python absolute imports. All tests passing to prevent regressions in `explain_file`, `get_impact`, and related tools.

### Fixed

- **Import graph edge resolution** — Improved `resolveJsPath` to handle additional extensions (.mjs, .cjs, .tsx) and better fileSet path handling. Import graph now correctly detects cross-file dependencies in complex project structures.

---

## [6.10.5] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Branching strategy tests** — Added regression tests verifying the develop-first branching workflow to ensure all PRs target develop before release merges to main.

---

## [6.10.4] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- **Bundled MCP tools extractImports export** — Fixed `extractImports` function not being exported from the import-graph factory in bundled gen-context.js, which caused `explain_file` (imports/callers) and `get_impact` MCP tools to fail with "extractImports is not a function" when running via `--mcp` server. Added comprehensive tests to prevent regression.

---

## [6.10.3] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- **MCP tools import graph analysis** — Fixed `extractImports` not being exported in bundled gen-context.js, which caused `explain_file` (imports/callers), `get_impact`, and `get_routing` tools to fail with "extractImports is not a function" error. Now all three tools correctly analyze file dependencies and impact blast radius.
- **Contributor attribution** — Added direct author commits for Denis Solonenko (GDScript extractor), Sean Campbell (Willow adapter, Python AST extractor), kumamaki (Claude adapter per-module), and Matt Van Horn (R language support) so they appear in GitHub contributors graph.

### Changed

- **Auto-sync workflow** — Added GitHub Actions workflow to automatically sync `develop` branch with `main` after each release, preventing future branch drift.

---

## [6.10.2] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Open-source agents documentation** — Comprehensive integration guides for OpenCode, Aider, OpenHands, and Cline with setup examples and context injection patterns. Clear separation of coding agents from inference backends.
- **Local LLM workflows guide** — Complete setup guide for Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM with model recommendations, performance tuning, and benchmarking. Emphasizes model-agnostic nature: no API costs, full privacy, offline capability.
- **Integrations sidebar** — New VitePress navigation section highlighting open-source agents, local LLMs, MCP server, and Repomix integration.

### Changed

- **README model-agnostic messaging** — Updated to clarify support for cloud LLMs, open-source agents, and local models with full privacy. Removed proprietary-focused language.
- **Quick-start guide** — Added links to new agent and local-LLM guides in "Next steps" section.

---

## [6.10.1] — 2026-05-10

### Added

- **R language support (Phase 1)** — Extract function signatures from `.r` and `.R` files with support for function definitions (`<-`, `=`, `<<-` forms), multi-line arguments with string-literal protection, S4 patterns (setGeneric, setMethod, setClass), and private function filtering. Shiny framework detection via `app.R`/`ui.R`/`server.R` triplet.
- **Native Python AST extractor** — Fallback to `python_ast.py` using `ast.parse()` for accurate extraction of complex signatures (multiline args, stacked decorators, complex generics). Preserves regex fallback for Python 2 / no-Python3 environments. Zero breaking changes to output format.

### Fixed

- **ReferenceError in `--query`** — Fixed variable scope issue where `adpIdx` was undefined when no context file present. Moved variable declaration to proper scope before conditional block.
- **Windows path handling** — Normalized path separators in nested path deduplication. Windows backslashes no longer cause false negatives when matching nested source roots.
- **.contextignore patterns** — Fixed bracket character classes (`[Bb]in/`) being treated as literals. Fixed trailing slashes on directory patterns not matching nested paths. Added error handling for malformed bracket syntax.
- **Claude adapter in per-module and hot-cold strategies** — Fixed adapter not being written to output in per-module and hot-cold context strategies.

---

## [6.10.0] — 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Workspace-scoped retrieval for monorepos** — New `src/workspace/detector.js` module detects workspace packages from `package.json` workspaces field (npm array and Yarn v2 `packages` format). Automatically infers target package from query tokens (e.g., "rate limiting payments" → `packages/payments/`). Flags `--package <name>` (explicit) and `--global` (disable scoping) control retrieval scope. Files inside inferred package receive +0.30 score boost for tighter context.

---

## [6.9.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Task metadata for segmentation** — All 18 benchmark repositories now tagged with language, repo type (framework/library/tool/application), and size class (small/medium/large) to enable segmented benchmark analysis.
- **Benchmark methodology documentation** — Comprehensive guide explaining what SigMap measures (retrieval accuracy, task success, prompt reduction, token reduction), why these metrics matter, and how the 90-task test set was selected and evaluated.
- **Answer usefulness evaluation** — New metric tracking whether retrieved context actually enabled correct answers, scored in three tiers: fully-useful (rank 1), partially-useful (ranks 2-5), not-useful (not retrieved). Complements task success proxy with granular answer quality assessment.

---

## [6.8.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Session memory with 4-hour TTL** — Store intent, top-ranked files, and last query in `.context/session.json` to enable context carry-forward across multiple `sigmap ask` calls. Session expires after 4 hours, preventing stale context fixation.
- **`sigmap ask --followup` flag** — Carry context from previous session with intent-aware boosting: +0.2 score for same intent, +0.1 for topic switch (different intent). Never reduces scores, only adds contextual signals.
- **`sigmap plan "<goal>"` command** — Analyze change impact before editing: rank files by confidence level (inspect first vs. likely to change), compute impact radius using dependency graph, identify affected tests. Outputs human-readable table or JSON.

---

## [6.7.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added

- **2-hop graph traversal with decay** — Extended graph-boosted retrieval from 1-hop (0.40 boost) to 2-hop (0.15 boost for transitive dependencies), improving retrieval accuracy by catching cross-module architecture patterns. Exported `GRAPH_BOOST_AMOUNTS` constants for transparency.
- **Hub suppression** — Automatically suppress common utility files (`utils/`, `helpers/`, `shared/`, `common/`, `index`) and high-fanout files (>20% of codebase) from graph boosts to reduce false-positive boosts and improve ranking signal quality.
- **Incremental signature cache** — Introduced `sigCache: true` config key to enable incremental extraction, caching extracted signatures by mtime. Only re-extracts changed files on subsequent runs, dramatically improving performance on large codebases.
- **Cache health statistics** — Display cache file size, entry count, and freshness in `--health` output (text and JSON formats) for visibility into cache state and efficiency.

---

## [6.6.5] — 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Monorepo JVM project detection** — Enhanced source root resolver to detect `src/main/{java,kotlin,scala}` and `app/src/main/{java,kotlin,scala}` in monorepo workspace packages (packages/*, apps/*, services/*, modules/*). Added `src/test/{java,kotlin}` and `app/src/main/scala` to DEEP_PATHS for consistent detection across monorepo and non-monorepo structures.

---

## [6.6.4] — 2026-04-29

### Changed

- **JVM path pattern refactor** — Extracted JVM path regex pattern into a reusable constant `JVM_PATH_PATTERN` in source-root-scorer.js for improved testability and reusability. No behavior changes.

---

## [6.6.3] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **JVM path pattern consistency** — Updated source root scorer regex to recognize Scala in both `src/main/scala` and `app/src/main/scala` directory patterns for consistent JVM project detection.

---

## [6.6.2] — 2026-04-29

### Added

- **srcDirs validation tests** — Comprehensive integration tests for srcDirs configuration validation. Tests verify all common directories, framework conventions, JVM project structures (Java, Kotlin, Scala), and proper path formatting.

---

## [6.6.1] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **JVM project structure support** — Added auto-detection of Java, Kotlin, and Scala project directories. `srcDirs` now includes `src/main/java`, `src/main/kotlin`, `src/main/scala`, `app/src/main/java`, `app/src/main/kotlin`, `src/test/java`, and `src/test/kotlin` for out-of-the-box support of JVM-based projects.

---

## [6.6.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Session memory** — Carry context across follow-up queries within a coding session. New `src/session/memory.js` module manages session state with 4-hour TTL. Previous session's top-5 files get +0.2 score boost in next query; boost reduced to +0.1 if intent differs (topic-switch guard).
- **`sigmap ask --followup`** — Reuse previous session's context when making follow-up queries. Session automatically saved after each `ask` command for seamless context carry-forward.
- **`sigmap plan "<goal>"`** — Analyze change impact and plan modifications. Returns files grouped by confidence (inspect-first vs likely-to-change), impact radius, and affected tests. Supports `--json` output for agent integration.

---

## [6.5.2] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **2-hop graph boost with decay** — `rank()` now traverses 2 hops in the dependency graph instead of 1. Direct imports (+0.40) and second-order imports (+0.15 with decay) receive score boosts for better context relevance in multi-layer dependency scenarios.
- **Hub suppression** — shared utility files (detected by >20% fanout threshold or static patterns like `util/`, `helper/`, `common/`) are now excluded from graph boosts to prevent over-boosting generic utilities.
- **Incremental signature cache (`sigCache`)** — new opt-in `sigCache: true` config key enables mtime-based caching of extracted signatures. Cache is automatically busted on version changes, and unchanged files skip re-extraction for faster subsequent runs.
- **Cache health statistics** — `--health` output now includes cache stats: entry count and disk size in KB. `--health --json` includes `cacheStats` field with `entries` and `sizeKb` when cache exists.

---

## [6.5.1] — 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Retrieval explain** — `rank()` and `scoreFile()` now return detailed signal breakdown (exactToken, symbolMatch, prefixMatch, pathMatch, penalty) for transparency in ranking decisions
- **7-intent ranking** — expanded intent detection from 4 to 7 patterns (debug, explain, refactor, review, test, integrate, navigate). Each intent applies tuned weights to prioritize relevant signals.
- **Negative-signal penalty layer** — formalized penalties for test files (0.4x), generated code (0.3x), documentation (0.2x), and node_modules (0.0x) to deprioritize non-source content

### Changed

- `formatRankTable` now shows penalty column and signals breakdown for top 3 results
- `formatRankJSON` now includes `intent` and `signals` fields in output for API consumers

---

## [6.5.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Source Root Resolver (v6.5)** — intelligent auto-detection of source directories for 17 languages and 50+ frameworks (Next.js, Django, Rails, Spring Boot, Flutter, Go, Rust, etc.). Uses multi-signal scoring: manifest files, language/framework detection, file density, git activity, and framework-specific srcDirs. Returns confidence level (high/medium/low) and detailed explanation. Integrated into `loadConfig()` with graceful fallback to legacy heuristics.
- **`.sigmapignore` pattern matching** — new `.sigmapignore` file support (fallback to `.contextignore`) for excluding directories. Supports simple patterns like `legacy/` and globs like `src/**`.
- **`sigmap roots` CLI command** — three modes: `--explain` (default, shows detected languages/frameworks and scores), `--json` (structured output), `--fix` (interactive prompt to correct srcDirs and write to config).
- **Monorepo detection and enumeration** — auto-detects monorepos via pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, nx.json, lerna.json, and package.json workspaces. Enumerates all sub-packages and common deep paths.

### Fixed

- **Framework-discovery tests** — updated registry entries to include all framework-specific srcDirs expected by legacy detector (Rails: db/spec/test, Laravel: resources/tests, Angular: projects/apps/libs, Next: hooks/utils).
- **Scoring penalty for framework srcDirs** — test directories (spec, test, tests) no longer penalized when explicitly in framework's srcDirs list.
- **CLI command ordering** — `roots` command handler now executes before `explain` to prevent flag conflict.

---

## [6.4.0] — 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Docs version labels** — homepage hero badge now shows Release (v6.4.0) and Benchmark (sigmap-v6.0-main) as separate labels instead of a single conflated "Latest: v6.0" pill
- **Generalization benchmark** — upgraded all v5.9-main references in `docs-vp/guide/generalization.md` to v6.0-main snapshot
- **README overclaim fix** — removed "every time" from the comparison table; trimmed top demo block from 4 commands to 2
- **v6.3.0 release notes** — added release note callout blocks to benchmark, retrieval-benchmark, and task-benchmark docs
- **MCP docs** — added v6.3 native tool registration callout to `docs-vp/guide/mcp.md`
- **Content-consistency test** — new `test/content/v640-trust-sync.sh` bash script with 11 checks catches version/copy regressions

---

## [6.3.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Native tool registration (Level 3)** — `codex.write()` injects a `## Tools` JSON block into AGENTS.md with 5 named sigmap shell tools (`sigmap_ask`, `sigmap_validate`, `sigmap_judge`, `sigmap_query`, `sigmap_weights`); Codex CLI and OpenCode surface these in their tool picker. `claude.write()` injects a `## Bash allowlist` section into CLAUDE.md with `permissions.allow` patterns for all sigmap commands; adding these to `.claude/settings.json` bypasses the Claude Code confirmation prompt. Both sections are idempotent and preserve human content.

---

## [6.2.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **`--setup` MCP auto-wire for 4 new targets** — `sigmap --setup` now registers the MCP server in `.vscode/mcp.json` (GitHub Copilot in VS Code 1.99+), `opencode.json` and `~/.config/opencode/config.json` (OpenCode), `~/.gemini/settings.json` (Gemini CLI), and `~/.codex/config.yaml` (Codex CLI — YAML format). All 5 new targets are idempotent and only written if the file already exists. Total `--setup` targets: 5 → 10.

---

## [6.1.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Tool instructions in every adapter (Level 1)** — each adapter's `format()` now embeds native-format SigMap command guidance: markdown table (copilot, codex), bullet list (claude), `#` comments (cursor, windsurf), instruction sentence (openai, gemini). Agents get `sigmap ask`, `sigmap validate`, and `sigmap judge` hints automatically in every generated context file.

---

## [6.0.3] — 2026-04-21

### Added

- **`--coverage` CLI flag** — enables test coverage annotation (`✓`/`✗` per function) at runtime without editing config; sets `testCoverage: true` on the loaded config before any run path.
- **`sigmap weights --export [file]`** — writes learned weights JSON to a file path, or prints to stdout if no path given (pipe-friendly for CI and team sharing).
- **`sigmap weights --import <file> [--replace]`** — merges imported weights into the local `.context/weights.json`; `--replace` discards existing weights and takes the imported set entirely. Incoming values are sanitized and clamped.

---

## [6.0.2] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **Duplicate adapter headers (#104, #96)** — `writeOutputs()` now strips the `formatOutput()` preamble (`<!-- Generated... -->` + `# Code signatures`) before passing content to adapters, preventing double headers on every run. Introduces `stripFormatHeader()` helper applied to all adapter paths including `writeClaude()`.
- **Bundled codex factory (#96)** — the inline `__factories["./packages/adapters/codex"]` in `gen-context.js` was still delegating to `openai.format()` after the source-file fix in v6.0.1. Now uses clean `# Code signatures\n\n` + context, matching the source adapter.

---

## [6.0.1] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **TypeScript extractor guard clauses (#97)** — `extractClassMembers` now skips control-flow keywords (`if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, `do`, `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `else`) that were incorrectly emitted as method signatures when they appeared inside class bodies.
- **Codex/AGENTS.md adapter preamble (#96)** — `packages/adapters/codex.js` no longer delegates to the OpenAI adapter. Output is now clean `# Code signatures\n\n<context>` markdown with no "You are a coding assistant…" preamble, no HTML comment metadata block, and no duplicate headers.

---

## [6.0.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Graph-boosted retrieval (v6.0)** — `rank()` in `src/retrieval/ranker.js` now accepts `opts.graph`. After scoring all files, a +0.4 `graphBoost` weight is added to 1-hop forward-import neighbors of any file with `score > 0`. Measured lift: +1.1pp (82.2% → 83.3% hit@5 using ranker.js on 90 benchmark tasks).
- **`DEFAULT_WEIGHTS.graphBoost: 0.4`** — new weight constant; path-normalized relative↔absolute conversion handles the sigIndex/graph format mismatch.
- **Incremental signature cache (`src/cache/sig-cache.js`)** — `loadCache`, `saveCache`, `getChangedFiles`, `updateCacheEntries` persist extracted signatures keyed by absolute path + mtime to `.sigmap-cache.json`. Version-keyed so upgrades automatically bust the cache. Ready to wire into `gen-context.js` for 80–95% speed reduction on re-runs.
- **Graph-boosted MCP `query_context`** — `src/mcp/handlers.js` now builds a dependency graph via `buildFromCwd` and passes it to `rank()`, giving agents multi-hop neighbor boosting for free.
- **README rewrite** — full 15-section conversion-optimised README (tagline, npx demo, ❌/✅ replace table, workflow arrow, canonical benchmark block, install options, integrations, try-it, start guide, why-not-embeddings, license).
- **`test/integration/v591-readme.test.js`** — 50 tests covering all 15 README sections and consistency rules.
- **`version.json` updated** — bumped to `6.0.0`, `benchmark_id` to `sigmap-v6.0-main`, metrics updated from live benchmark run: `overall_token_reduction_pct: 96.9`, `retrieval_lift: 5.8`, `graph_boosted_hit_at_5: 0.833`.

### Changed

- **All package versions** synced to `6.0.0` via `scripts/sync-versions.mjs`.
- **`retrieval_lift`** corrected from 5.9× to 5.8× (actual benchmark run average).
- **`overall_token_reduction_pct`** corrected from 98.1% to 96.9% (simple average across 18 repos from live matrix run; 98.1% was a weighted-by-size figure from a prior run).
- **`task_success_proxy_pct`** corrected from 53.3% to 52.2% (live benchmark confirms 47/90 correct).
- **`prompts_per_task`** corrected from 1.67 to 1.68 (live benchmark output).

---

## [5.9.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added

- **`sigmap bench --submit`** — new CLI command that reads `version.json` + local `.context/benchmark-history.ndjson` and formats a shareable community benchmark submission block (text and `--json`).
- **`scripts/verify-checksums.mjs`** — new standalone script to verify a downloaded binary against its `.sha256` checksum file; exits 0 on match, 1 on mismatch.
- **SHA-256 checksum generation in `build-binary.mjs`** — each binary build now writes a matching `dist/<artifact>.sha256` file automatically.
- **22 integration tests** in `test/integration/v590-binary-polish.test.js` covering all acceptance criteria.

### Changed

- **`scripts/verify-binary.mjs`** — extended smoke tests with 5 new checks (tests 6–10): `ask`, `weights`, `history`, `bench --submit`, and `bench --submit --json`.
- **`version.json`** — bumped to `5.9.0`, `benchmark_id` updated to `sigmap-v5.9-main`.
- **`test/integration/v580-trust-completion.test.js`** — version assertion relaxed from exact `5.8.0` to `>= 5.8.0` so future releases don't break the test.

---

## [5.8.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added

- **`docs-vp/guide/compare-alternatives.md`** — new page comparing SigMap vs embeddings/RAG, RepoMix, Copilot context, and manual curation with side-by-side tables.
- **`docs-vp/guide/walkthrough.md`** — end-to-end walkthrough on a real repo (gin): ask → validate → judge → learn, with before/after token and cost table.
- **Canonical benchmark header block** — `:::info` snapshot block added to all 5 benchmark guide pages (benchmark, retrieval, task, quality, generalization), each referencing `sigmap-v5.8-main`.
- **30-second demo strip** — homepage `docs/index.html` now shows a terminal demo section (ask → validate → judge) directly below the stats bar.
- **User-type routing table** — `docs-vp/index.md` landing now opens with a "Who is this for?" table routing new users, daily users, team setup, MCP users, and monorepo evaluators.
- **Both new guide pages in sidebar** — `compare-alternatives` and `walkthrough` added under a new "Guides" section in `docs-vp/.vitepress/config.mts`.
- **`version.json` — `retrieval_lift` field** — `metrics.retrieval_lift: 5.9` added; `version` bumped to `5.8.0`; `benchmark_id` updated to `sigmap-v5.8-main`.
- **33 new integration tests** in `test/integration/v580-trust-completion.test.js` covering all 7 acceptance criteria.

### Changed

- **`version.json`** — bumped to `5.8.0`, `benchmark_id` updated to `sigmap-v5.8-main`.
- **SVG metrics** — `docs/impact-banner.svg`: `78.9%→80.0%` hit@5, `1.69→1.68` prompts, `40.6%→40.8%` prompt reduction card, "hallucinates" replaced with "unsupported answers"; `docs/comparison-chart.svg`: `78.9%→80.0%`.
- **`docs/index.html`** — `softwareVersion` structured-data updated to `5.8.0`; stats bar language count corrected from `21` to `29`.
- **`docs/readmes/vscode-extension.md`** — language count updated from `21` to `29 languages and formats` in badge, table, and architecture diagram.
- **`docs-vp/index.md`** — tagline updated to remove stale v5.5 text; `v5.7.0` snapshot reference updated to `v5.8.0`; stale v5.5 launch strip replaced with v5.8 announcement.
- **Benchmark sub-pages** — `retrieval-benchmark.md`, `task-benchmark.md`, `quality-benchmark.md`, `generalization.md` all updated to `v5.8.0` as latest saved run.
- **`generalization.md`** — adds "Why this matters" intro callout; stale `v5.5.0` snapshot reference updated to `v5.8.0`.
- **`v560-docs-sync` tests** — version assertions updated to accept `v5.8.0` as the current benchmark version.

---

## [5.7.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- **`version.json`** — canonical source of truth for version, benchmark date, language count (29), MCP tools (9), tests (495), and official benchmark metrics snapshot.

### Changed

- **README metrics** — `78.9%` → `80.0%` hit@5 and `1.69` → `1.68` prompts per task; benchmark table now matches official v5.7 snapshot.
- **README what's-new block** — replaced stale "v5.2" section with "What's new in v5.7" entry covering version.json, metrics sync, and language count correction.
- **`docs/index.html`** — `softwareVersion` updated from `5.5.0` to `5.7.0`.
- **`docs/languages.html`** — all user-facing "21 languages" occurrences updated to "29 languages and formats" (OG meta, Twitter meta, structured data headline, hero heading, stat badge, section heading, section sub).
- **`docs/quick-start.html`** — language count nav card updated from "21 languages" to "29 languages and formats".
- **`docs/repomix.html`** — current-copy language count updated from "21 languages" to "29 languages and formats".

---

## [5.6.0] — 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **Docs version labels** — all guide pages updated from `v5.2`/`v5.3`/`v5.4` workflow references to `v5.5`.
- **Benchmark sub-pages** — `retrieval-benchmark.md`, `task-benchmark.md`, `quality-benchmark.md` now show `v5.5.0` as the latest saved run (was `v5.3.0`/`v5.4.0`).
- **Canonical metrics** — `generalization.md` and `cli.md` updated to `80.0%` hit@5 and `1.68` prompts per task (were `78.9%` / `1.69`).
- **Judge vocabulary** — `judge.md` and `cli.md` judge examples now use only `Groundedness`, `Support level`, `Unsupported symbols`; removed `pass/fail` and raw `"verdict"` key.
- **Language count** — `docs/index.html` heading, list item, and structured-data description updated from `21 languages` to `29 languages and formats`; `softwareVersion` updated to `5.5.0`.
- **MCP tool count** — `mcp.md` description, heading, and test example updated from `8 tools` to `9 tools`.

### Added

- **Troubleshooting Issue 16** — new entry explaining the `--report` vs `--health` coverage-grade inconsistency and the v5.5 fix, with a before/after comparison table.
- **`test/integration/v560-docs-sync.test.js`** — 17 assertions covering all acceptance criteria for the docs sync.

---

## [5.5.0] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Coverage grade now accurate for mixed-content projects** — `coverageScore()` counts only code files (`.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.go`, etc.) in the denominator. Previously, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `README.md`, and other non-code files were counted, causing inflated D-grades even when all code was covered (reported in discussion #81).
- **`--report` coverage label** — now reads `code files` instead of `source files`, and prints `(N non-code files skipped — json, md, config)` when non-code files were excluded.
- **`--report` actionable guidance** — modules marked `← attention needed` (<50% coverage) now show a tip block listing the three common causes and how to fix each.
- **`--health` label disambiguation** — coverage line renamed from `coverage … source files` to `file access … files accessible in srcDirs`, making it clearly distinct from the `--report` coverage metric.
- **`autoMaxTokens` silent-override warning** — when `autoMaxTokens` is active and overrides the user's `maxTokens` config value, `--report` now emits an explicit note explaining the override and how to disable it.

### Changed

- `src/analysis/coverage-score.js` exports `CODE_EXTS` (the allowlist Set) for use by other modules and tests.
- `coverageScore()` return object gains a `nonCodeSkipped` field (number of non-code files found in srcDirs but excluded from the denominator).

---

## [5.4.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Neovim plugin (`sigmap.nvim`)** — first-class Neovim integration in `neovim-plugin/`. Provides `:SigMap [args]` (async regen), `:SigMapQuery <text>` (TF-IDF retrieval in a floating window), `auto_run = true` (`BufWritePost` autocmd for source files), `require('sigmap').statusline()` for lualine/statusline widgets, and `:checkhealth sigmap` (validates Node 18+, binary presence, context file freshness).
- **Binary auto-detection** — plugin resolves the sigmap binary automatically: global `sigmap` → `npx sigmap` → local `gen-context.js` fallback; no manual config needed for most setups.
- **`release-neovim.yml` workflow** — tag `neovim-v*` to validate Lua files, run the full integration suite across Node 18/20/22, package the plugin as a `.tar.gz`, and create a GitHub Release.
- **CI now runs integration tests** — `ci.yml` runs both `node test/run.js` and `node test/integration/all.js` on every push and pull request.

---

## [5.3.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- **MCP auto-wire: Windsurf** — `sigmap --setup` now registers the MCP server in `.windsurf/mcp.json` (project-level) and `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` (global) using the standard `mcpServers` shape.
- **MCP auto-wire: Zed** — `sigmap --setup` now registers a context server in `~/.config/zed/settings.json` using Zed's `context_servers` shape (`command.path` / `command.args`).
- **Updated `--setup` snippet** — help output now prints manual config snippets for all four tools: Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and Zed.

### Changed

- `registerMcp()` skips each target when the file does not exist and never overwrites an already-registered `sigmap` entry (idempotent).

---

## [5.2.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Learning engine** — new local-only weight store at `.context/weights.json` with path-normalized per-file multipliers, clamp safety (`0.30..3.00`), and decay on every non-reset mutation.
- **`sigmap learn`** — manually boost or penalize ranked files with `--good <files...>`, `--bad <files...>`, and `--reset`. Invalid or out-of-repo paths are skipped with warnings; the command exits non-zero when no valid targets remain.
- **`sigmap weights [--json]`** — explainability view for learned ranking multipliers. Human mode prints a compact table and reset hint; JSON mode emits the raw learned-weight object.
- **Opt-in judge learning** — `sigmap judge --response <file> --context <file> --learn` now extracts file headings from query/generated context files and applies small boosts or penalties when groundedness is confidently high or low.

### Changed

- **Ranker learned weighting** — `rank(query, sigIndex, { cwd })` now loads `.context/weights.json` and multiplies non-empty-query scores by learned file multipliers. Empty-query fallback ordering is unchanged.
- **Learning-aware rank call sites** — `sigmap ask`, `sigmap --query`, `sigmap validate --query`, and MCP `query_context` now pass `cwd` into the ranker so learned weights apply consistently across CLI and MCP flows.

## [5.1.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Benchmark history tracking** — all three benchmark scripts (`run-retrieval-benchmark.mjs`, `run-benchmark.mjs`, `run-task-benchmark.mjs`) now append a structured NDJSON entry to `.context/benchmark-history.ndjson` after each run (`type: "retrieval" | "token-reduction" | "task"`).
- **`sigmap history` benchmark trend rows** — when `.context/benchmark-history.ndjson` exists, `sigmap history` prints a retrieval `hit@5` sparkline row and a token-reduction sparkline row below the usage table. The command no longer exits early when the usage log is empty.
- **Dashboard `readBenchmarkTrend` uses local history** — `src/format/dashboard.js` now prefers `.context/benchmark-history.ndjson` over the CI-only `benchmarks/results/` directory, so the dashboard hit@5 trend chart populates for all users after running any benchmark locally.

---

## [5.0.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`sigmap judge --response <file> --context <file>`** — rule-based groundedness scoring engine (`src/judge/judge-engine.js`). Computes a 0–1 score from token overlap between an LLM response and its source context. Exits 0 when verdict is `pass`, exits 1 on `fail`. Supports `--json` (emits `{ score, verdict, reasons }`) and `--threshold` override.
- **Config `extends`** — `gen-context.config.json` now accepts an `"extends"` key pointing to a local JSON file path or HTTPS URL. The base config is deep-merged (DEFAULTS → base → local), with HTTPS responses cached for 1 hour in `.context/config-cache/`.
- **`sigmap history [--last N] [--json]`** — displays last N usage log entries as a table with a Unicode sparkline (▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█) for the token trend. Reads from `.context/usage.ndjson` (requires `tracking: true` in config).

---

## [4.3.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`sigmap validate`** — validates config (srcDirs exist, exclude patterns, maxTokens range), computes coverage as sig-index size / total source files, warns when coverage < 70%, exits 1 on hard errors. Optional `--query "<q>"` checks that PascalCase/camelCase symbols in the query appear in top-5 ranked context. Supports `--json`.
- **`sigmap --ci [--min-coverage N] [--json]`** — GitHub Actions exit gate: exits 0 when coverage ≥ threshold (default 80%), exits 1 otherwise. Uses sig-index vs source file count for a budget-aware coverage metric. Ready for `npx sigmap --ci` in CI workflows.
- **`extractQuerySymbols(query)`** — internal helper that extracts PascalCase and camelCase identifiers from a query string for symbol-level coverage checks in `sigmap validate`.

### Changed

- **`sigmap ask`** — now emits a stderr warning when coverage < 70%, pointing users to `sigmap validate` for diagnosis.

---

## [4.2.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`sigmap ask "<query>"`** — unified pipeline: intent detection → ranked mini-context → coverage check → cost estimate → risk level in one command. Supports `--json` for machine-readable output.
- **Intent detection** (`detectIntent`) — classifies queries as `debug`, `explain`, `refactor`, `review`, or `search` and adjusts ranking weights accordingly for higher-relevance results.
- **`sigmap query --context`** — writes a targeted mini-context (top-5 ranked files, ≤ 2 000 tokens) to `.context/query-context.md` for direct pasting into an LLM prompt.
- **`--cost [--model <name>] [--json]`** — prints per-model token/dollar cost comparison (raw source vs SigMap output). Supports `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `claude-opus-4`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, and more.
- **`sigmap suggest-profile [--short]`** — reads the last git commit message and staged files to recommend a context profile (`debug`, `architecture`, `review`, or `default`).
- **`sigmap compare [--json]`** — human-readable CLI wrapper over the retrieval benchmark scripts, showing SigMap vs baseline hit@5, token counts, and lift multiplier.
- **`sigmap share`** — prints a shareable one-liner with live benchmark numbers and copies it to the clipboard via `pbcopy`/`xclip`.

---

## [4.1.2] — 2026-04-16 — Feat: --output <file> flag for custom context path

### Added

- **`--output <file>` flag** — write signatures to any custom path, not just
  an adapter's fixed location:
  ```bash
  sigmap --output .context/ai-context.md          # default generation
  sigmap --adapter claude --output shared/sigs.md # adapter + custom path
  ```
  The custom file is written **in addition to** the adapter's default output so
  existing tooling is unaffected.

- **Automatic discovery for `--query`** — the resolved path is persisted to
  `gen-context.config.json` as `customOutput` so subsequent `--query` runs
  find it automatically without needing to pass `--output` again:
  ```bash
  sigmap --output .context/ai-context.md          # generates + persists path
  sigmap --query "add a new extractor"             # auto-finds .context/ai-context.md
  ```

- **Priority order for `--query` context resolution** (most specific first):
  1. `--output <file>` flag — explicit path
  2. `--adapter <name>` flag — adapter's fixed output path
  3. `customOutput` in `gen-context.config.json` — persisted from last `--output` run
  4. Probe all known adapter output paths — existing fallback behaviour

- **Nested directories created automatically** — `--output a/b/c/file.md`
  creates any missing parent directories.

### Tests

- Added `test/integration/output-flag.test.js` (13 tests) covering: custom
  file creation, parseable headers, config persistence, nested dirs, missing
  arg error, `--adapter` + `--output` combo, explicit `--query` with `--output`,
  auto-discovery via persisted config, missing-file error, `--output` overrides
  `--adapter` during `--query`.

---

## [4.1.1] — 2026-04-16 — Fix: --query works with any adapter output

### Fixed

- **`--query` fails after `--adapter` generation** (`[sigmap] no context file found`):  
  `buildSigIndex` hardcoded `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as the only
  context file path, so `--query` always failed when any adapter other than
  `copilot` wrote to a different location (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, etc.).

  `buildSigIndex` now probes all nine known adapter output paths in priority
  order and returns the first non-empty index:
  ```
  copilot → claude → codex → cursor → windsurf → openai → gemini → llm-full → llm
  ```
  Human-written preamble before the `## Auto-generated signatures` marker
  (e.g. custom content in `CLAUDE.md`) is skipped so those `###` sections
  don't pollute the signature index.

- **`--adapter <name> --query "..."` combination ignored the adapter flag**:  
  The `--query` handler now detects a co-present `--adapter` flag, resolves
  that adapter's output path, and reads from it directly — so both forms work:
  ```bash
  # generate with claude adapter, then query without re-specifying adapter
  node gen-context.js --adapter claude
  node gen-context.js --query "add a new extractor"

  # or pin explicitly in one command
  node gen-context.js --adapter claude --query "add a new extractor"
  ```

- **`--analyze --json` output truncated at ~8 KB on macOS**:  
  Calling `process.exit(0)` immediately after `process.stdout.write(largeJson)`
  truncated output because the underlying pipe write is asynchronous even
  when `write()` returns `true`. Fixed by using the write callback so the
  process exits only after the OS has accepted all bytes.

### Tests

- Added `test/integration/query-adapter.test.js` (17 tests) covering every
  adapter output path (unit + CLI), probe order, marker-skipping, explicit
  `opts.contextPath` override, and empty-project fallback.

---

## [4.1.0] — 2026-04-15 — Smart Budget: auto-scaling token budget

### Added

- **Auto-scaling token budget** (`autoMaxTokens: true`, default on):  
  Replaces the old fixed 6 000-token default with a formula that sizes the budget to your repo:
  ```
  effective = clamp(ceil(totalSigTokens × coverageTarget), 4000, floor(modelContextLimit × maxTokensHeadroom))
  ```
  - `coverageTarget` (default `0.80`) — target fraction of source files to include
  - `modelContextLimit` (default `128000`) — model context window size; hard cap = `limit × headroom`
  - `maxTokensHeadroom` (default `0.20`) — fraction of the model window reserved for SigMap output (default hard cap: **25 600 tokens**)
  - Minimum floor: **4 000 tokens** (prevents tiny repos from being under-budgeted)
  - When the hard cap prevents hitting the coverage target by more than 10 percentage points, SigMap warns and suggests `strategy: "per-module"`

- **Four new config keys** (all optional, documented in `gen-context.config.json.example`):
  | Key | Default | Description |
  |---|---|---|
  | `autoMaxTokens` | `true` | Enable auto-scaling |
  | `coverageTarget` | `0.80` | Target fraction of source files |
  | `modelContextLimit` | `128000` | Model context window (tokens) |
  | `maxTokensHeadroom` | `0.20` | Fraction of context for SigMap |

- **Post-run summary annotation**: coverage line now shows `[budget: N auto-scaled]` when the formula overrode the configured `maxTokens`.

- **Per-module strategy budget fix**: each module now gets its own full effective budget instead of a proportional slice, which was the limiting factor that made `per-module` less useful than advertised.

- **Tracking log fields**: `autoBudget: true/false` and `budgetLimit: N` added to `.context/usage.ndjson` entries.

- **12 new integration tests** (`test/integration/auto-budget.test.js`): cover MIN floor, proportional scaling, hard cap, disabled auto-scaling, custom `coverageTarget`/`modelContextLimit`/`maxTokensHeadroom`, warning emission, and empty-project edge case.

### Changed

- `autoMaxTokens: false` + explicit `maxTokens` preserves the old fixed-budget behaviour exactly — fully backwards compatible.
- `printReport` now labels the budget `(auto-scaled)` vs `(fixed)` in the report line.

### Benchmarks (v4.1.0)
- Token reduction: **97.6% average** across 18 repos ✅  
- Retrieval hit@5: **84.4%** ✅  
- With auto-scaling enabled, all 18 benchmark repos now stay within a sensible budget that targets ≥ 80% file coverage rather than the old 6 K ceiling.

---

## [4.0.2] — 2026-04-15 — Bundle factory fix (re-release of 4.0.1)

### Fixed
- v4.0.1 was published to npm/GitHub Packages before the binary CI step ran, which meant the published package contained the incomplete bundle (missing `./src/analysis/coverage-score` factory). v4.0.2 is a clean re-release with all fixes from 4.0.1 and the correct bundle.

---

## [4.0.1] — 2026-04-15 — Config auto-detection fix

### Fixed
- **Bundled `loadConfig` lacked `detectAutoSrcDirs`**: the inline `__factories["./src/config/loader"]` copy inside `gen-context.js` was a stripped-down version that returned raw `DEFAULTS` without filesystem auto-detection. After `--init` wrote a config with 6 hardcoded `srcDirs`, auto-detection was bypassed and custom project directories were missed — causing coverage to drop for any project whose source lives outside those 6 dirs. The bundled loader is now fully in sync with `src/config/loader.js`.
- **`--init` config hardcoded `srcDirs`**: `gen-context.config.json.example` had `"srcDirs": ["src","app","lib","packages","services","api"]` as a plain value. Any project that ran `--init` would lock into those 6 dirs and lose auto-detection. The example now omits `srcDirs` entirely and uses `_comment` keys to explain that auto-detection runs automatically. Users who need custom dirs can add `srcDirs` manually.
- **`gen-context.config.json` (SigMap repo)**: restored explicit `"srcDirs": ["src","packages"]` so the repo's own context generation is not affected by auto-detection picking up `docs-vp/`, `scripts/`, `test/`, and `vscode-extension/`.
- **Example `outputs` updated**: `gen-context.config.json.example` now lists all four standard adapters — `["copilot","codex","claude","gemini"]` — matching the recommended setup.

### Benchmarks (v4.0.1)
- Token reduction: **97.6% average** across 18 repos ✅
- Retrieval hit@5: **84.4%** (up from 83.3% in v4.0.0)

---

## [4.0.0] — 2026-04-15 — Intelligence Layer

### Added
- **Coverage score** (`src/analysis/coverage-score.js`): measures what fraction of source files made it into context after token-budget application.
  - Grade scale: A ≥ 90% · B ≥ 75% · C ≥ 50% · D < 50%
  - Confidence indicator: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
  - Per-module breakdown per srcDir via `perModule` Map
- **Confidence indicators in all output writers**: every generated file now includes a metadata comment:
  ```
  <!-- sigmap: version=4.0.0 confidence=HIGH coverage=94% dropped=9 commit=abc1234 -->
  ```
  Applies to: `copilot`, `claude`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `openai`, `gemini` adapters.
- **`--report` module heatmap**: ASCII bar chart per srcDir showing coverage percentage:
  ```
  Module Coverage:
    src                ████████████████ 100% (64/64 files)
    packages           ██████████████░░  86% (12/14 files)
  ```
  `--report --json` gains a `coverage` object with `score`, `grade`, `confidence`, `totalFiles`, `includedFiles`, `droppedFiles`, and `perModule`.
- **`--diff` risk score**: each changed file is now classified LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH based on reverse-dependency BFS, public API exports, route status, and config-file status:
  ```
  [sigmap] Risk: Changed files (3):
    src/auth/service.ts         [HIGH]    — exports public API, 5 downstream dependents
    src/config/database.ts      [MEDIUM]  — config file
    src/utils/format.ts         [LOW]     — no dependents, internal utility
  ```
- **Coverage in post-run summary**: every normal run now prints a `Coverage` line:
  ```
   Coverage       : A (97%)  — 76 of 78 source files included
  ```
- **Coverage in `--health` and `--health --json`**: coverage grade, score, and file counts are included in both text and JSON health output. `--health --json` adds `coverage`, `coverageGrade`, `coverageConfidence`, `coverageTotalFiles`, `coverageIncludedFiles`.

### Changed
- **Token budget drop order step 5**: now uses `signalQuality = sigs / linesOfCode` (least-informative files dropped first) instead of the previous "fewest sigs" heuristic.
- **`src/eval/analyzer.js` `analyzeFiles()` output**: each file stat now includes `linesOfCode` and `signalQuality` fields.

### Benchmark (v4.0.0)
- Token reduction: **97.6% average** across 18 repos (target ≥ 97.0%) ✅
- Retrieval hit@5: 83.3% (retrieval improvement targeted in v4.5 with adaptive query)

---

## [3.5.0] — 2026-04-14 — Phase C/D Intelligence Expansion

### Added
- **Phase C framework-specialized extractors** for richer framework-level signatures:
  - TypeScript React: `.tsx` component metadata (props, hooks, handlers)
  - Vue SFC: `.vue` component metadata (props, emits, slots, lifecycle)
  - Python dataclass/model patterns: dataclasses, Pydantic models, ORM-style fields
- **Phase D cross-module pattern extractor**:
  - Detects DI containers and injection signatures
  - Detects service, repository, middleware, and controller layer hints
  - Detects type-to-implementation linkage and domain use-case cues
  - Flags unsafe patterns (null-check risks, weak validation, error exposure)

### Changed
- **Extractor mapping expanded** so framework-specific files route to specialized extractors (`.tsx` and `.vue`) for higher-signal signatures.
- **Standalone/bundled runtime wiring updated** to include new Phase C/D extractors in factory resolution.

### Testing
- Added integration coverage for Phase C extractors (`phase-c-extractors`) and Phase D pattern inference (`phase-d-patterns`).
- Current results:
  - `phase-c-extractors`: 3 passed, 0 failed
  - `phase-d-patterns`: 10 passed, 0 failed

---

## [3.4.0] — 2026-04-14 — Phase A/B Coverage Expansion

### Added
- **Phase A extractor support** for high-value config and docs formats:
  - TOML: `.toml`
  - Java/INI properties: `.properties`
  - XML: `.xml`
  - Markdown technical docs: `.md`
- **Bundled runtime factory wiring** for new extractors so standalone/binary execution resolves the same modules as source mode.

### Changed
- **Framework-aware source discovery** defaults expanded for Next/React, Angular, Rails, Laravel, and Flask/Python-style layouts.
- **Strategy audit coverage rules** updated to treat Phase A formats as supported instead of important unsupported baselines.
- **Default srcDirs** broadened to improve first-run context quality on framework-heavy repositories.
## [3.3.4] — 2026-04-14 — Binary Bundle Fix

### Fixed
- **Standalone binary pre-flight now passes for new P1 extractors**
  - Added missing bundled `__factories` entries in `gen-context.js` for:
    - `./src/extractors/graphql`
    - `./src/extractors/protobuf`
    - `./src/extractors/sql`
    - `./src/extractors/terraform`
  - Resolves CI/build failure in `scripts/build-binary.mjs` reporting missing `src/` modules in bundle.

---

## [3.3.3] — 2026-04-14 — Auto srcDirs + P1 Extractors

### Added
- **P1 extractor support** for additional high-value formats:
  - SQL: `.sql`
  - GraphQL: `.graphql`, `.gql`
  - Terraform: `.tf`, `.tfvars`
  - Protobuf: `.proto`
- **Extractor registration updates** across runtime and core mapping so the new file types are parsed consistently.

### Changed
- **Auto source directory detection** (framework- and manifest-aware) in config loading and strategy auditing.
- **Auto maxDepth tuning** in strategy audit based on repository file-depth distribution.
- **Benchmark strategy-audit reports refreshed** to reflect improved source discovery and coverage.
- **Language support count updated from 21 to 25** across core README and extension README.

---

## [3.3.1] — 2026-04-10 — Patch: `--each --adapter` flag combination

### Fixed
- **`--each --adapter <name>` now works correctly** · [#37](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/37)
  - Running `sigmap --each --adapter claude` (or any adapter) from a parent directory containing multiple git repos now correctly writes the chosen adapter output (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`) inside each sub-repo.
  - Root cause: the `--adapter` handler ran before `--each` in `main()`, so `--each` was never reached when both flags were supplied together. The `--each` block is now evaluated first.
  - `runEach()` accepts an optional `adapterOverride` parameter that merges `outputs`/`adapters` into each sub-repo's config before calling `runGenerate`, mirroring how the standalone `--adapter` flag works.
  - Invalid adapter names passed alongside `--each` now exit non-zero with a clear error message listing valid adapters.

---

## [3.3.0] — 2026-04-08 — Context-Aware CLI & Command Switcher

### Added
- **Context-aware `--help` output** — `gen-context.js` and `gen-project-map.js` now detect how they were invoked and show the matching command in every usage example:
  - `npx sigmap --help` shows `npx sigmap <flag>`
  - `sigmap --help` shows `sigmap <flag>`
  - `gen-context --help` shows `gen-context <flag>`
  - `node gen-context.js --help` shows `node gen-context.js <flag>` (unchanged for local users)
  - Detection uses `process.argv[1]` path analysis (npx cache path, basename without `.js`, fallback)
- **`docs/cli.html` command picker** — four-tab switcher ("How you run it:") above the flags reference terminal updates every code block on the page (all `.tw` spans and `.term-title` bars) to the selected invocation style. Applies equally to `gen-project-map` references. Selection is saved in `localStorage` and restored on next visit.
- **`docs/readmes/`** — `vscode-extension.md` and `jetbrains-plugin.md` added for docs site cross-linking
- **`gen-context.config.json`** — example config committed alongside the repo for reference
- **Gemini adapter context file** — `.github/gemini-context.md` now generated alongside the copilot instructions file
- **SEO improvements across all docs pages** — structured data, canonical tags, improved meta descriptions, and `sitemap.xml` updated to v3.3.0

### Added (from `fix/defaults-css-coverage-budget-36` · #38)
- **`--each` flag — multi-repo parent directory support** · [#37](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/37)
  - Running `node gen-context.js --each` (or `sigmap --each`) from a parent directory that contains multiple independent git repos now processes each repo in one shot.
  - Scans immediate subdirectories; a subdirectory qualifies when it contains `.git` or a recognised project manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`).
  - Each sub-repo is processed independently: it loads its own `gen-context.config.json` when present, uses its own `srcDirs`, and writes its own context files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` etc.) inside itself.
  - Summary printed at the end: `[sigmap] --each: done — 3 succeeded`.
  - Distinct from `--monorepo` (which processes workspace packages inside a single repo); `--each` targets sibling repos under a shared parent directory.

### Fixed
- **Default excludes expanded + `changesCommits` corrected** · [#36](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/36)
  - `changesCommits` default raised from `5` to `10` to match the documented recommended value.
  - Added `playwright-tmp`, `playwright-report`, `test-results`, `.turbo`, `storybook-static`, `.docusaurus` to the default `exclude` list so they are skipped on modern JS/TS projects without requiring manual config.
- **CSS extractor: utility-class noise elimination** · [#36](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/36)
  - Files where ≥70% of top-level selectors are single-word (e.g. Tailwind / compiled utility CSS) are now detected automatically and class extraction is skipped entirely, preventing the output from being flooded with low-signal entries like `.p-4`, `.flex`, `.text-sm`.
  - For semantic CSS, BEM/hyphenated class names (e.g. `.modal-header`, `.btn-primary`) fill output slots first; single-word names only fill remaining slots up to 8.
- **`testCoverage` false-positive coverage markers eliminated** · [#36](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/36)
  - Removed the "all word tokens" pass from `buildTestIndex` that caused common words appearing anywhere in a test file (comments, variable names) to mark unrelated functions as `✓` tested.
  - Index now only includes tokens extracted from test name strings (`it('...')`, `test('...')`, `describe('...')`) and identifiers directly invoked inside `expect(fn())` / `assert(fn())` calls.
- **Token budget: mock/fixture files drop before test files** · [#36](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/36)
  - Added `isMockFile()` helper and priority-9 drop tier in `applyTokenBudget`. Paths matching `mock`, `mocks`, `stub`, `stubs`, `fake`, `fakes`, `demo`, `__mocks__`, `fixtures` or file suffixes like `.mock.ts` now drop before test files (priority 8) and after generated files (priority 10), keeping real production code in context longer.
  - Fixed `applyTokenBudget` loop direction: generated/mock/test files now drop first (as intended) rather than source files being dropped first.
- **`--monorepo` now respects configured output adapter** · [#39](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/39)
  - Removed hardcoded `outputs: ['claude']` override — `--monorepo` now inherits `outputs` from the root config, defaulting to `copilot` (writes `copilot-instructions.md` per package).
- **IDE command resolution parity (VS Code/Open VSX/JetBrains)** · [#34](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/34)
  - Unified resolver now checks both `sigmap` and `gen-context` executables with consistent fallback order.
  - Improved cross-platform probing for local workspace bins, Volta/nvm/npm-global installs, and OS-specific command lookup (`where` on Windows, shell lookup on macOS/Linux).
  - JetBrains plugin now resolves commands more reliably outside Node-only projects and provides OS-aware install guidance when command lookup fails.

### Changed
- **Installation guidance for plugin users**
  - Updated VS Code/Open VSX and JetBrains setup docs to include all supported install paths: npm global, npm local, npx, standalone binaries in PATH, and project-local `gen-context.js`.

---

## [3.2.1] — 2026-04-07 — Patch: IDE Command Resolution & Plugin Parity

### Added
- **IDE command resolution parity (VS Code / Open VSX / JetBrains)** · [#34](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/34)
  - Unified resolver checks both `sigmap` and `gen-context` executables with consistent fallback order
  - Improved cross-platform probing for local workspace bins, Volta/nvm/npm-global installs, and OS-specific command lookup (`where` on Windows, shell lookup on macOS/Linux)
  - JetBrains plugin resolves commands more reliably outside Node-only projects and provides OS-aware install guidance when command lookup fails
- **`scripts/sync-versions.mjs`** — one-shot script to bump version across all package manifests and `gen-context.js` in sync
- **Updated plugin docs** — VS Code/Open VSX and JetBrains setup docs updated with all supported install paths (npm global, npm local, npx, standalone binaries, project-local `gen-context.js`)

---

## [3.2.0] — 2026-04-07 — Cross-Platform Standalone Binaries

### Added
- **Standalone binaries** — macOS (arm64 + x64), Linux x64, Windows x64 built via Node.js SEA
  - No Node.js or npm required to run SigMap
  - Download from GitHub Releases: `sigmap-darwin-arm64`, `sigmap-darwin-x64`, `sigmap-linux-x64`, `sigmap-win32-x64.exe`
  - SHA-256 checksums in `sigmap-checksums.txt` attached to every release
- **`scripts/build-binary.mjs`** — reproducible local binary build for the current platform
- **`scripts/verify-binary.mjs`** — smoke tests `--version`, `--help`, default generate, `--health`, `--report` against a fixture repo
- **`.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml`** — GHA matrix builds all 4 targets on tag push; attaches artifacts to the GitHub Release
- **`test/fixtures/binary-smoke/`** — minimal fixture project used by CI smoke tests
- **`docs/binaries.md`** — install guide covering download, `chmod +x`, macOS Gatekeeper, Windows SmartScreen, and checksum verification

### Technical
- Uses [Node.js SEA](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html) (Node 20 `--experimental-sea-config` + `postject`)
- `gen-context.js` updated to include previously-missing `src/` modules (`todos`, `coverage`, `prdiff`) in the SEA bundle; `requireSourceOrBundled()` fallback remains SEA-compatible
- Binary builds run natively per OS in GHA (no cross-compilation)

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-07 — Global Command Detection & VS Code Prerelease Fix

### Added
- **VS Code extension: global command auto-detection** — extension now finds `gen-context` installed via Volta, nvm, npm, or Homebrew without requiring `gen-context.js` in the project root or a manual `sigmap.scriptPath` setting
  - Probe chain: local `node_modules/.bin` → `~/.volta/bin` → `~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin` (newest first) → `/usr/local/bin` → `/opt/homebrew/bin` → `~/.npm-global/bin` → login-shell `which`
  - Works on macOS GUI apps that do not inherit shell `PATH`
  - `resolveGlobalCommand()` + unified `resolveRunner()` added to `vscode-extension/src/extension.js`
- **VS Code extension: actionable error message** — when command is not found, notification offers "Copy install command" (copies `npm install -g sigmap` to clipboard) and "Open settings" buttons instead of a plain warning
- **Prerelease GitHub Actions workflow** — new `prerelease-publish.yml` for manual alpha/beta/rc releases across all 5 platforms (npm, GitHub Packages, VS Code, Open VSX, JetBrains) without marking as @latest
  - VS Code/Open VSX uses `major.minor.patch` versioning (VSCE prerelease constraint)
  - npm/JetBrains use full semver prerelease suffix (e.g. `3.1.0-beta.1`)

### Fixed
- **`output` config key not honored for copilot adapter** · [#30](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/30)
  - Custom `output` path in config now correctly used for copilot adapter instead of hard-wired `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - Added `resolveAdapterPath()` helper to centralize adapter path resolution
  - Other adapters (claude, cursor, windsurf) continue to use fixed paths as designed
  - 5 new integration tests ensure custom paths work correctly across all config combinations
- **JetBrains plugin: global `gen-context` command support** · [#29](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/issues/29)
  - Plugin now resolves command via fallback chain: local `gen-context.js` → `node_modules/.bin/gen-context` → system `PATH`
  - Enables use in Java, Rust, Go and other non-Node projects with `gen-context` installed globally via Volta/nvm/npm
- **VS Code prerelease versioning** — workflow previously failed publishing because semver-suffixed versions (e.g. `3.1.0-alpha.1`) are rejected by VSCE; fixed by splitting into separate `npm_version` and `vscode_version` outputs

### Technical
- `resolveRunner()` returns `{ type: 'script' | 'command', path }` allowing extension to run either `node "path/gen-context.js"` or `"~/.volta/bin/gen-context"` without modification to the terminal command

### How to release (tag triggers automatic publish)
```bash
git tag v3.1.0
git push origin v3.1.0
# npm-publish.yml auto-triggers and publishes to all 5 platforms
```

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-06 — Platform: Multi-Adapter Architecture

### Added
- **Multi-adapter platform** — `packages/adapters/` with 6 output adapters: `copilot`, `claude`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `openai`, `gemini`
- **`--adapter <name>` CLI flag** — generate output for a specific adapter only (e.g. `node gen-context.js --adapter openai`)
- **`adapt()` in packages/core** — programmatic API: `const { adapt } = require('sigmap'); adapt(context, 'openai')`
- **New config key `adapters`** — replaces `outputs`; old `outputs` key is silently mapped for full backward compatibility
- **OpenAI adapter** — formats context as an OpenAI system prompt, writes `.github/openai-context.md`
- **Gemini adapter** — formats context as a Gemini system instruction, writes `.github/gemini-context.md`
- **API stability guarantee** — `packages/core` API is now semver-stable; breaking changes require v4.0
- **20 new integration tests** in `test/integration/adapters.test.js`

### Changed
- `packages/core/index.js` — adds `adapt()` export alongside existing `extract`, `rank`, `scan`, `score`, `buildSigIndex`
- `writeOutputs()` in `gen-context.js` — now routes `openai`, `gemini` through adapter pipeline

### Backward compat
- `outputs: ["copilot","claude"]` config still works — automatically mirrored to `adapters`
- All existing CLI flags unchanged

- **Docs refresh** — align roadmap and docs site references to the v2.10 milestone.

### Go / No-go criteria
- Full test suite passes (extractor + integration).
- Report output includes chart-friendly numeric series and summary stats.
- Benchmark metrics remain stable or improve versus v2.9 baseline.
- Generated docs and release metadata are version-synced to `2.10.0`.

- **`packages/cli/`** — new `sigmap-cli` thin wrapper that exposes `{ CLI_ENTRY, run }` for programmatic CLI invocation and forward-compat with the v3.0 adapter architecture.
- **`packages/core/README.md`** — full programmatic API reference with usage examples for all five exported functions.
- **`exports` field in `package.json`** — `require('sigmap')` resolves to `packages/core/index.js`; `require('sigmap/cli')` resolves to `packages/cli/index.js`.
- **`test/integration/core-api.test.js`** — 15 integration tests covering: all exports present, `extract` for JS/TS/Python, file-path extension detection, unknown language returns `[]`, never throws on bad input, `rank` with empty map, `rank` sorted shape, `scan` clean/redact, `score` shape, `buildSigIndex` returns Map, CLI `--version` backward compat, CLI `--help` no crash.

### Changed
- `package.json` `"version"` bumped to `2.4.0`.
- `package.json` `"files"` — added `"packages/"` so `sigmap-core` and `sigmap-cli` are published with the root package.
- `gen-context.js` `VERSION` constant bumped to `2.4.0`.

- **`--query "<text>"` CLI flag** — ranks all context files by relevance and prints a scored table (Rank | File | Score | Sigs | Tokens) plus the top-3 signature blocks; `--query "<text>" --json` for machine-readable output; `--query "<text>" --top <n>` to limit result set.
- **`query_context` MCP tool** — 8th MCP tool; accepts `{ query: string, topK?: number }` and returns the same ranked table as the `--query` CLI flag; live within any running MCP session.
- **Retrieval config** — `config.retrieval.topK` (default 10) and `config.retrieval.recencyBoost` (default 1.5×) added to `src/config/defaults.js`.
- **`test/integration/retrieval.test.js`** — 23 integration tests covering tokenizer unit tests, ranker sorting/scoring/topK/empty-query, `formatRankTable`, `formatRankJSON`, CLI `--query` flags, and MCP `query_context`.

### Changed

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Diagnostics & analyze command** — `src/eval/analyzer.js`: per-file breakdown of signature count, token cost, extractor used, and test coverage status.
- **`--analyze` CLI flag** — prints a per-file table (File | Extractor | Sigs | Tokens | Covered) across all srcDirs; respects `exclude` config.
- **`--analyze --json` flag** — outputs the same breakdown as structured JSON (`{ files, totalSigs, totalTokens, slowFiles, fileCount }`).
- **`--analyze --slow` flag** — re-times each extractor and flags any file whose extraction takes >50ms in the table.
- **`--diagnose-extractors` CLI flag** — runs all 21 language extractors against `test/fixtures/` and compares output to `test/expected/`; exits non-zero if any extractor diverges, shows first diff line per failure.
- **`test/integration/analyze.test.js`** — 14 integration tests covering `analyzeFiles`, `formatAnalysisTable`, `formatAnalysisJSON`, and all four CLI flags.

### Validation gate

- **`--benchmark` CLI flag** — runs retrieval through all tasks in `benchmarks/tasks/retrieval.jsonl`, prints a markdown table (Task | Query | hit@5 | RR | Tokens) plus aggregate metrics; `--benchmark --json` for machine-readable output.
- **`--eval` CLI flag** — alias for `--benchmark`.
- **`src/eval/scorer.js`** — pure metric functions: `hitAtK(ranked, expected, k)`, `reciprocalRank(ranked, expected)`, `precisionAtK(ranked, expected, k)`, `aggregate(results)`. Never throws.
- **`src/eval/runner.js`** — task loader (`loadTasks`), sig-index builder (`buildSigIndex`), keyword ranker (`rank`, `tokenize`), and main `run(tasksFile, cwd)` entry point. Reads generated context file from disk; no in-memory state.
- **`test/integration/benchmark.test.js`** — 10 integration tests covering scorer unit tests, tokenizer, task loading, empty-file edge case, metrics shape, and `--benchmark --json` CLI output.

- **Structural diff mode** — `--diff <base-ref>` writes a signature-level diff section comparing current signatures against a base branch.
- **Test coverage markers** — opt-in per-function `✓`/`✗` hints by scanning test directories (`testCoverage: true`).
- **Impact radius hints** — opt-in reverse dependency annotations (`impactRadius: true`).
- **New helper extractors**:
  - `src/extractors/deps.js` — Python and TS/JS dependency extraction + reverse dep map.

- `test/integration/v2plus.test.js` — 3 integration tests for todos, coverage markers, and structural diff.
- `test/integration/all.js` — unified integration runner and `test:integration:all` npm script.

### Changed
- **Enriched multi-language extractors** — return-type hints (`→ Type`) and richer signatures across C++, C#, Dart, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Svelte, Swift, TypeScript, and Vue.
- **Python extractor** — dataclass/BaseModel field collapse, top-level docstring hints, fixed field bleed across class boundaries.
- **TypeScript extractor** — interface property types, class method return hints, compact hook return shapes for `export function useX()`, union type truncation extended to 35 chars.
- Removed stale development files: `TIMELINE.md`, `scripts/bundle.js`, `scripts/make-icon.py`, `scripts/inject-search.py`, `scripts/backfill-npm.sh`, `examples/slack-context-bot.js`, `examples/copilot-prompts.code-snippets`.

### Fixed
- Python `tryExtractBaseModelFields` no longer bleeds fields into subsequent classes.
- TypeScript interface member type previews preserve longer union strings (20 → 35 chars).
- TypeScript function-style hooks (`export function useX`) now include compact return object shapes.

### Validation gate
- 21/21 extractor tests passed
- 17/17 integration suites passed (262 individual tests)
- `node gen-context.js --report` → ~93.5% reduction


## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **VS Code extension** (`vscode-extension/`) — zero-dependency extension for VS Code / VS Code-compatible editors:
  - **Status bar item** — shows health grade (A/B/C/D) and time since last regeneration; refreshes every 60 s and immediately on file-system change to `copilot-instructions.md`.
  - **`SigMap: Regenerate Context`** command — runs `node gen-context.js` in an integrated terminal from the workspace root.
  - **`SigMap: Open Context File`** command — opens `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in the editor.
  - **Stale context notification** — warns when `copilot-instructions.md` is > 24 h old; offers one-click regeneration or "Don't show again" suppression per workspace.
  - **`contextforge.scriptPath` setting** — override the path to `gen-context.js` when it is not at the project root.
  - `onStartupFinished` activation — loads within 3 s of VS Code opening, does not block startup.
- **Docs site search** — lightweight client-side keyword search added to all 6 HTML docs pages (`index.html`, `quick-start.html`, `strategies.html`, `languages.html`, `roadmap.html`, `repomix.html`):
  - Press `/` anywhere to open the search overlay; `Escape` or click outside to close.
  - Searches all headings, paragraphs, and list items in the current page.
  - Up to 12 results shown with snippet preview; matching text highlighted in amber.
  - Click a result to scroll to the exact section with a 2-second amber outline highlight.
  - Zero external dependencies — ~60 lines of inline JS per page. Theme-aware (dark/light).
- **`.npmignore`** — excludes `test/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `examples/`, `.claude/`, `vscode-extension/`, `.github/workflows/` and planning docs from npm publish. Published package contains only the runtime files listed in `package.json#files`.
- **`test/integration/v1.5.test.js`** — 58 integration tests covering all v1.5 features:
  - npm package integrity (name, bin, engines, zero deps, .npmignore exclusions)
  - shebang line presence and correctness
  - extension manifest structure (commands, configuration, activation)
  - extension.js API coverage (status bar, notification, commands, scriptPath)
  - search injection verified in all 6 docs pages (overlay, input, keyboard handlers, highlights)

### Notes
- The VS Code extension requires the `vscode` peer dependency at runtime (provided by the editor). It has no npm runtime dependencies of its own.

### Validation gate
- `node gen-context.js --version` → `1.5.0` ✔  *(note: version bumped separately if desired)*
- `node test/integration/v1.5.test.js` → 58/58 pass ✔
- `node test/run.js` → 21/21 extractor tests pass ✔
- `npm pack --dry-run` → no `test/`, `docs/`, or `vscode-extension/` in artifact ✔
- All 6 docs pages: press `/` → search overlay opens; type "python" → result appears ✔

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **`explain_file` MCP tool** — deep-dive tool for a single file. Given a relative path, returns three sections: `## Signatures` (from the indexed context file), `## Imports` (resolved relative dependencies from the live source file), and `## Callers` (reverse import lookup across all indexed files). Gracefully returns partial output if the file is not on disk.
- **`list_modules` MCP tool** — returns a markdown table listing all top-level module directories found in the context file, sorted by token count descending, with columns: `Module | Files | Tokens`. Helps agents pick the right `module` arg for `read_context`.
- **Strategy-aware health scorer** — `src/health/scorer.js` and `--health` display now read `gen-context.config.json` and adjust the low-reduction penalty threshold by strategy:
  - `full` (default): 60% reduction threshold — unchanged behaviour.
  - `hot-cold` / `per-module`: reduction penalty disabled — intentionally small hot outputs are not penalised.
  - `hot-cold` only: adds a `context-cold.md` freshness check (`strategyFreshnessDays`). If the cold context file is >1 day stale, up to 10 pts are deducted.
- **New `--health` output fields** — `strategy:` line always visible; `cold freshness:` line shown for `hot-cold` strategy.
- **`test/integration/mcp-v14.test.js`** — 13 integration tests covering `explain_file` and `list_modules`:
  - 7-tool count verification
  - Signature extraction from index
  - Imports and Callers sections (file on disk)
  - Graceful error for unknown path, missing arg, no context file
  - Token count and table structure in `list_modules`
  - Multi-call session combining both new tools
- **`test/integration/observability.test.js`** — 12 new unit tests for strategy-aware scorer:
  - `strategy` field in all return objects
  - No reduction penalty for `hot-cold` and `per-module`
  - Reduction penalty still applied for `full`
  - `strategyFreshnessDays` null/populated correctly
  - Grade A for a fresh, untracked project

### Fixed
- Health scorer: projects with **zero tracking history** (brand-new or never run with `--track`) are no longer penalised for "0% reduction". `tokenReductionPct` is only set when `totalRuns > 0`.

### Changed
- MCP server now exposes **7 tools** (was 5 before v1.3, 5 in v1.3). `tools/list` assertion updated in `mcp-server.test.js`.
- `gen-context.js` VERSION bumped to `1.4.0`
- MCP server `SERVER_INFO.version` bumped to `1.4.0`
- `package.json` version bumped to `1.4.0`

### Validation gate
- `node gen-context.js --version` → `1.4.0` ✔
- `echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | node gen-context.js --mcp` → 7 tools ✔

- `node test/integration/mcp-server.test.js` → 16/16 pass ✔
- `node test/run.js` → 21/21 extractor tests pass ✔

---



### Added
- **`--diff` CLI flag** — generates context only for files changed in the current git working tree (`git diff HEAD --name-only`). Useful in CI and pre-review workflows where you only want signatures for files you've touched.
- **`--diff --staged` variant** — restricts context to files in the git staging area only (`git diff --cached --name-only`). Ideal as a pre-commit check.
- **Smart fallback** — both `--diff` modes automatically fall back to a full `runGenerate` when: outside a git repo, no changed files, or all changed files are outside tracked `srcDirs`. No silent failures.
- **`--diff --report`** — when both flags are used together, prints a side-by-side comparison of diff-mode vs full-mode token counts and savings.
- **`watchDebounce` config key** — new key in `gen-context.config.json` (default: `300`) controls the debounce delay (ms) between file-system events and regeneration in watch mode. Configurable per project.
- **`test/integration/diff.test.js`** — 6 integration tests covering all diff-mode scenarios:
  - Diff-only output excludes unchanged files
  - `--staged` excludes unstaged modifications
  - Empty diff fallback to full generate
  - Non-git-repo fallback
  - Changed files outside srcDirs fallback
  - Multiple changed files all appear in output

### Changed
- Watch mode debounce reduced from **500 ms → 300 ms** (default). Now reads `config.watchDebounce || 300` — fully configurable.
- `gen-context.js` VERSION bumped to `1.3.0`
- MCP server version bumped to `1.3.0`
- `package.json` version bumped to `1.3.0`
- `src/config/defaults.js` — added `watchDebounce: 300` key

### Validation gate
- `node gen-context.js --version` → `1.3.0` ✔
- `node gen-context.js --diff` on a repo with changes → output contains only changed-file sigs ✔
- `node gen-context.js --diff --staged` → output contains only staged-file sigs ✔
- `node test/integration/diff.test.js` → 6/6 pass ✔
- `node test/run.js` → 21/21 extractor tests pass ✔

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **`--init` now scaffolds `.contextignore`** alongside `gen-context.config.json`. Running `node gen-context.js --init` on a fresh project creates both files. `.contextignore` is pre-populated with sensible defaults (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.generated.*`, etc.). Safe to re-run — existing files are never overwritten.
- **`test/integration/strategy.test.js`** — 9 integration tests covering `per-module` and `hot-cold` strategies:
  - `per-module`: asserts one `context-<module>.md` per `srcDir`, overview file references all modules, cross-module signature isolation
  - `hot-cold`: asserts `context-cold.md` is created, primary output contains only hot files, `hotCommits` config controls the boundary
  - Both strategies: fallback behaviour when `srcDir` is missing or repo has no git history
- **`sigmap` npm binary alias** — `package.json` `bin` now exposes both `gen-context` (existing) and `sigmap` (new alias), making `npx sigmap` work ahead of full npm publish in v1.5
- **`--diff` and `--diff --staged` listed in `--help`** — help text documents the upcoming flags so tooling auto-complete picks them up

### Changed
- `package.json` version bumped to `1.1.0` (syncs with already-shipped v1.1 strategy features)
- `gen-context.js` `VERSION` constant bumped to `1.1.0`
- `src/mcp/server.js` `SERVER_INFO.version` bumped to `1.1.0`
- `--init` no longer exits early when config already exists — it still skips writing config but continues to check / write `.contextignore`
- `keywords` in `package.json` expanded: added `token-reduction`, `code-signatures`

### Validation gate
- `node gen-context.js --version` → `1.1.0` ✔
- `cat package.json | grep version` → `"version": "1.1.0"` ✔
- `node gen-context.js --init` on a fresh dir → both `gen-context.config.json` and `.contextignore` created ✔
- `node test/integration/strategy.test.js` → all 9 tests pass ✔
- `node test/run.js` → 21/21 extractor tests pass ✔

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Context strategies** — new `"strategy"` config key with three options:
  - `"full"` (default) — existing behaviour, single output file, all signatures
  - `"per-module"` — one `.github/context-<module>.md` per top-level `srcDir` plus a
    thin always-injected overview table (~100–300 tokens); ~70% fewer injected tokens
    per question with zero context loss; no MCP required
  - `"hot-cold"` — recently committed files auto-injected as usual; all other files
    written to `.github/context-cold.md` for MCP on-demand retrieval; ~90% fewer
    always-injected tokens; best with Claude Code / Cursor MCP enabled
- **`"hotCommits"`** config key — controls how many recent git commits count as "hot"
  for the `hot-cold` strategy (default: 10)
- **`docs/CONTEXT_STRATEGIES.md`** — comprehensive strategy guide: decision tree,
  four worked-scenario comparisons (fix-a-bug, cross-module question, daily dev,
  onboarding), full configuration reference, migration guide, and feature-compatibility
  matrix
- README: new "Context strategies" section with inline examples linking to full guide
- `gen-context.config.json.example`: `strategy` and `hotCommits` keys with comments

### Changed
- `gen-context.js` version remains `1.0.0`; `runGenerate` now dispatches to
  `runPerModuleStrategy` or `runHotColdStrategy` based on `config.strategy`
- `getRecentlyCommittedFiles(cwd, count)` now accepts a count parameter so
  `hotCommits` is respected
- `--help` text updated with strategy descriptions

### Validation gate
- `strategy: per-module` on arbi-platform: `3 modules, overview ~117 tokens, total ~4,058 tokens`
- `strategy: hot-cold` on arbi-platform: `79 hot files ~3,700 tokens, 1 cold ~363 tokens`
- `strategy: full` unchanged: `80 files, ~3,980 tokens, 94.9% reduction`
- All 21 checks pass post-deployment

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Self-healing CI** — `examples/self-healing-github-action.yml`: weekly cron workflow that queries the GitHub Enterprise Copilot API for acceptance rate; automatically opens a PR with regenerated context when rate drops below threshold (default 30%) or context file is stale (> 7 days); falls back to staleness check when no API token is configured
- **`scripts/ci-update.sh`** — CI helper script: `--fail-over-budget` (exits 1 if output tokens exceed budget), `--track`, `--format cache`; designed for required CI pipeline steps
- **`--suggest-tool "<task>"`** — recommends a model tier (fast / balanced / powerful) from a free-text task description using keyword matching against `src/routing/hints.js` TIERS; `--json` variant returns machine-readable `{ tier, label, models, costHint }` for IDE integrations
- **`--health`** — composite 0-100 health score derived from: context staleness (days since last regeneration), average token reduction %, and over-budget run rate; letter grade A–D; `--json` variant for dashboards and CI
- **`src/health/scorer.js`** — zero-dependency health scoring module: `score(cwd)` reads usage log + context file mtime; never throws
- Integration test: `test/integration/system.test.js` — 15 tests covering suggest-tool (all three tiers, `--json` shape, missing-description guard) and health (`--json` field presence, score range, grade values, run counters)

### Changed
- `gen-context.js` version bumped to `1.0.0`; help text expanded with `--suggest-tool`, `--health`
- `package.json` version bumped to `1.0.0`
- `src/mcp/server.js` version bumped to `1.0.0`

- 177/177 tests pass (21 extractor + 156 integration)
- `node gen-context.js --suggest-tool "security audit" ` → tier: powerful
- `node gen-context.js --health --json` → `{ score, grade, tokenReductionPct, daysSinceRegen, ... }`
- Self-healing CI workflow validates via `node gen-context.js --health --json` in check job

- **`src/tracking/logger.js`** — zero-dependency append-only log module; exports `logRun(entry, cwd)`, `readLog(cwd)`, and `summarize(entries)`; uses NDJSON (one JSON object per line) compatible with standard Unix tools
- **`--report --history`** — prints aggregate summary from `.context/usage.ndjson` (total runs, avg reduction %, avg tokens, over-budget count, first/last run timestamps); add `--json` for machine-readable output
- **`docs/ENTERPRISE_SETUP.md`** — comprehensive enterprise guide: GitHub Enterprise REST API acceptance rate tracking, CI token reporting with Prometheus/Grafana dashboard integration, self-hosted runner configuration, usage log analysis examples
- `tracking: false` default added to `src/config/defaults.js`
