This is the landing page for the public benchmark story. It answers four different questions:

| If you want to prove... | Open |
|---|---|
| SigMap reduces context size dramatically | [Token reduction](/guide/benchmark) |
| SigMap finds the right file more often | [Retrieval benchmark](/guide/retrieval-benchmark) |
| SigMap reduces retries and wrong-context answers | [Task benchmark](/guide/task-benchmark) |
| SigMap keeps large repos inside model limits | [Quality benchmark](/guide/quality-benchmark) |

## Official v7.0.0 snapshot (with R language support)

Latest saved benchmark run: **2026-06-19 (v7.24.0)**

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Token reduction repos | 21 (including R: ggplot2, dplyr, shiny) |
| Retrieval benchmark repos | 18 (core languages) |
| Total tasks | 90 |
| Average token reduction (all 21) | **97.0%** |
| Retrieval hit@5 (18 core) | **76%** |
| Graph-boosted hit@5 | **76%** |
| Random baseline hit@5 | 13.6% |
| Prompt reduction | **39.4%** (2.84 → 1.72 prompts) |
| GPT-4o overflow repos without SigMap | **16 / 21** |
| GPT-4o monthly input savings at 10 calls/day | **$9,899.90** |

## What each benchmark proves

### 1. Token reduction (21 repositories)

- Raw source across benchmark set: **13,499,894** tokens (21 repos)
- Final SigMap output: **~470,000** tokens
- Overall reduction: **97.0%**
- **New in v6.11.1:** R language support verified
  - ggplot2: 94.3% reduction (381.5K → 21.7K tokens)
  - dplyr: 93.4% reduction (145.1K → 9.5K tokens)
  - shiny: 96.2% reduction (264.6K → 10.0K tokens)
- **New in v6.12.0:** demand-driven *Surgical Context* (`ask --mode index` + the `get_lines` MCP tool) cuts upfront `ask` context further on top of the figures above by emitting symbol pointers instead of bodies — see the [Surgical Context guide](/guide/surgical-context).
- **Line anchors (v6.13.0):** extended to JavaScript and to class methods / interface members (TS & JS), raising index-mode token reduction on real repos from ~4.6% to 32–42% (axios 42.1%, fastify 41.1%, svelte 36.8%, vue-core 32.4%).

### 2. Retrieval quality

- SigMap hit@5: **76%**
- Graph-boosted hit@5: **76%** (+0.0pp with dependency graph)
- Random baseline: **13.6%**
- Lift: **6.0x**

This is the best benchmark when the question is: *"Does SigMap actually put the right file in context?"*

### 3. Task outcomes

- Correct: **47 / 90** (52.2%)
- Partial: **24 / 90** (26.7%)
- Wrong: **18 / 90** (20%)
- Average prompts: **2.84 → 1.72**

This is the best benchmark when the question is: *"Does the developer need fewer retries to finish the job?"*

### 4. Quality and overflow

- **16/21** repos overflow GPT-4o's 128K context window without SigMap
- R repos add to overflow risk: ggplot2 and shiny both overflow without SigMap
- **5,200+** files would be hidden from the model in the raw-flow scenario
- **16,500+** symbols are surfaced in SigMap output across all benchmark repos
- With SigMap: **0/21 repos overflow** — all repos fit within 128K context

This is the best benchmark when the question is: *"Why does token reduction matter operationally?"*

## Open the HTML dashboard

The easiest way to inspect the latest benchmark run is the self-contained HTML report:

```bash
node scripts/run-benchmark-matrix.mjs --save --skip-clone
open benchmarks/reports/benchmark-report.html
```

That generates synchronized JSON plus a dashboard for token, retrieval, quality, and task metrics together.

## Reproduce the full benchmark set

```bash
node scripts/run-benchmark.mjs --save --skip-clone
node scripts/run-retrieval-benchmark.mjs --save
node scripts/run-quality-benchmark.mjs --save
node scripts/run-task-benchmark.mjs --save
node scripts/run-benchmark-matrix.mjs --save --skip-clone
```

Each benchmark repository is **pinned to a fixed commit** in `scripts/run-benchmark.mjs` (fetched by SHA on clone). The corpus is frozen, so retrieval and token numbers move only when SigMap's own ranking/extraction changes — not when an upstream repo does. This makes hit@5 a true release-over-release signal rather than a moving target.

The matrix run writes:

- `benchmarks/reports/token-reduction.json`
- `benchmarks/reports/retrieval.json`
- `benchmarks/reports/quality.json`
- `benchmarks/reports/task-benchmark.json`
- `benchmarks/reports/benchmark-matrix.json`
- `benchmarks/reports/benchmark-report.html`
